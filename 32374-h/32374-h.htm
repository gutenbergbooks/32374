<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce to you my friend, Dick
Hamilton.</p>

<p>Dick, here are the boys, thousands of them.</p>

<p>Boys, here is Dick Hamilton.</p>

<p>Now I hope you will shake hands and become
good friends; not doing as I have sometimes seen
boys do, when introduced, hang back and size
each other up, as if distrusting each other.</p>

<p>Go right up to Dick, get a good grip on his
hand, and squeeze for all you're worth. I'll
wager you can't make him cry "enough!"</p>

<p>I know he will like you, boys, and I hope you'll
like Dick. He's a fine fellow, if I do say it myself,
for I'm a sort of relation to him. He's got
lots of money, but he uses it in the right way, to
help his friends, and it doesn't keep him from
getting into trouble.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to give you a story of Dick
and his fortune; how he tried to fulfil the strange
condition of his mother's will; how he escaped the
toils of the sharper, was the target for many
cranks, as well as well-meaning persons; how he
aided the "fresh-air kids," and, finally, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv">iv</a></span>
gold mines had failed, how he worked hard to
escape the clutches of his uncle Ezra.</p>

<p>As you have taken kindly to some of the other
books I have been privileged to write for you, I
hope you will like this one; and now, if you have
read thus far, you may turn the pages and find
out what Dick had to do in order to retain his
millions.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Howard R. Garis</span>.</p>

<h2>DICK HAMILTON'S FORTUNE</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>DICK IS IN A HURRY</h3>

<p>"Here comes Dick Hamilton!" exclaimed a
flashily-dressed youth to his companion, no less
gaily attired, as the two stood in front of a building
from which sounded a peculiar clicking noise.</p>

<p>"So it is, Guy," was the answer. "Let's get
him into a game. Maybe I can win a little money.
I need it, for I'm nearly dead broke."</p>

<p>"I thought you always had all the cash you
wanted, Simon," remarked Guy Fletcher, with
something like a sneer in his voice. "I know I
loaned you some the other day."</p>

<p>"Do you think that lasted until now?" inquired
Simon Scardale, glancing down at his patent
leather shoes. "I'm short of ready money now,
and if we can get your friend Hamilton into a
game of billiards I think I can beat him."</p>

<p>"He's no friend of mine," returned Guy, with
a short laugh. "He isn't my kind, even if his
father is a millionaire."</p>

<p>"That's the main reason why you ought to cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2">2</a></span>tivate
his acquaintance," returned Simon. "It pays
to keep in with such fellows. But here he is.
Let me do the talking. You needn't play if you
don't want to."</p>

<p>The two boys, who in spite of their fine clothes,
did not have an air of good breeding, watched
the approach of Dick Hamilton as he sauntered
down the main street of the town that pleasant
afternoon late in June.</p>

<p>Dick was a boy a little above the average
height, well built, with curling brown hair and
eyes of the same hue. The eyes were bright and
clear, and, when he looked at you they seemed
to glint like moss agates, as some of his friends
used to say.</p>

<p>"And you ought to see them when he's excited,"
one of Dick's acquaintances once remarked.
"His eyes sparkle and seem to look
right through you."</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to see that Dick was
well dressed, with that careless air of studied
negligence which so marks the person accustomed
to fine raiment. Dick wore his garments
as if he was "used to them and not dressed up,"
as Fred Murdock remarked. There was that
about him which at once proclaimed him for what
he was&mdash;the son of a very wealthy man, for his
father, Mortimer Hamilton, counted his fortune
in the millions.</p>

<p>As Dick came opposite the place whence issued
that peculiar sound, produced by ivory balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3">3</a></span>
hitting against one another, he was hailed by Simon
Scardale.</p>

<p>"I say, Dick, come in and have a little game of
billiards?"</p>

<p>Dick paused and looked at the speaker with
a quizzical glance.</p>

<p>"Who's going to play?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;for one," replied Simon.
And maybe Guy, here, will take a cue. I'll bet
I can beat you, and I'll give you twenty-five points
to start with. I'll bet you ten dollars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," answered Dick, in rather languid
tones, but the sparkle in his brown eyes
showed there was more spirit in the words than
at first might be apparent. "I don't believe I
care to play."</p>

<p>"Afraid I'll beat you!" exclaimed Simon, with
a sneer.</p>

<p>"You were very far from doing that the last
time you played at my house," retorted Dick,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that&mdash;er&mdash;that was on a table you
were used to, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's worried about losing the money!" interrupted
Guy Fletcher. "Come on, Simon, I'll play
you. I'm not afraid of ten dollars, even if my
father isn't quite as wealthy as his."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Guy's father was very far
from being as well off as Mr. Hamilton, but Guy
took upon himself as much importance, and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4">4</a></span>
himself as many airs, as though his parent was
a multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" exclaimed Dick sharply, straightening
up and thrusting his hands in the pockets
of his well-fitting coat. "Now don't you fellows
get any wrong notions into your heads. Go a
little slow. You asked me to come into a public
billiard-room and play a game with you. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you refused because you're afraid!"
retorted Guy.</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong," replied Dick
coolly. "I refused because, in the first place, I
don't play billiards in a public resort like this.
I like the game, but I have a fine table at home,
and I see no reason why I should waste my time
hanging around in a place that's thick with tobacco
smoke, and where the language isn't the
most polite, not to put it too strong. Besides,
the tables are in such poor condition that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you've turned Miss Nancy!" exclaimed
Simon, with a mean smirk.</p>

<p>"If you think so just come up to my gymnasium
and put on the boxing gloves with me,"
invited Dick with a meaning smile; but Simon
knew better than to accept. He had once boxed
a friendly round with Dick and had been sore
for a week afterward, for Simon was "soft."</p>

<p>"Another reason," continued Dick, "is that I
never gamble, whether it's over a game of billiards
or something else. I don't believe it's right.
It isn't a question of money at all. In fact, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5">5</a></span>
you need a little cash, I don't mind lending it to
you. But I'll not gamble for it.</p>

<p>"However," went on the wealthy youth, "don't
let me stand in the way of you two having a good
time. 'Every one to their notion,' as the old lady
said when she kissed the cow," and Dick laughed.</p>

<p>"What's the cow got to do with it?" inquired
Simon, who did not see the point of Dick's joke.</p>

<p>"Afraid," murmured Guy, but so low that
Dick did not hear him.</p>

<p>"The cow," retorted Dick, with a glance at
Simon, "is a second cousin to the one that jumped
over the moon. But, aside from all this," he
continued, more seriously, "if I did feel like playing
billiards with you in there, I couldn't do it
this afternoon, for I promised my father I'd be
home early. He has an appointment with me&mdash;a
very important one&mdash;and I'm in a hurry to keep
it."</p>

<p>"Didn't look so, by the way you were walking
along the street a moment ago," sneered Simon.</p>

<p>"I was just looking at some new fishing tackle
in White's window," answered Dick. "I have
my horse tied in front of the post-office, and I
guess you know he goes fast enough to take me
home in a hurry. Now I think I'll say ta-ta, and
get along. Try to work some one else into your
billiard game," and, with a nod that had in it
not the least sign of displeasure, in spite of his
firm words, Dick turned and walked off.</p>

<p>"Well, if he ain't the limit!" ejaculated Guy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6">6</a></span>
"He makes me tired. Come on in, I'll play you
a game; but not for ten dollars. Dad growled
the other day because I asked him for money, and
I've got to go slow."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd taken him at his word and borrowed
about twenty-five dollars from him," remarked
Simon, as he followed Guy into the
billiard-room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick had reached the post-office,
where his horse, a handsome bay of fine spirit,
but gentle disposition, was waiting him. The
animal whinnied with pleasure as the lad came
up, and when he patted the black muzzle, the
horse showed every evidence of delight.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they think I can't get home in
a hurry on you, Rex?" asked Dick, as he loosened
the strap and vaulted into the saddle. "Come on,
now, show 'em how you can go!"</p>

<p>The splendid animal was off like a shot, many
persons in the street turning to look at the pleasing
picture the well-built youth made on his handsome
steed. Past the billiard parlor Dick rode at
a fast pace, and several youths inside hurried to
the door.</p>

<p>"There he goes," remarked Simon, with a
sneer. "I'd like to take some of the starch out
of him."</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired another player, chalking his
cue.</p>

<p>"Dick Hamilton."</p>

<p>"He hasn't any starch in him," was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7">7</a></span>
answer. "He's one of the best fellows in the
world. One of the very few who has not been
spoiled by their father's wealth. You don't know
Dick Hamilton, or you wouldn't say he's stiff
or proud."</p>

<p>"We don't want to know him," put in Guy.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd be proud to," went on the player
at the next table. "He isn't in my class, or,
rather, I'm not in his, but he always bows pleasantly
and speaks to me every time we meet. He's
a real sport, he is. None of your tin-horn
variety."</p>

<p>Through the main street of the town Dick
rode, waving his hand now and then to acquaintances
who saluted him. To some he called out
cheery words of greeting, and to several elderly
men he bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>As Dick turned out of the main thoroughfare
into one that led to the handsome mansion where
he and his father lived, he came in sight of a
spectacle that made him pause. It was a rattletrap
of a wagon, drawn by a horse that seemed
as much in danger of falling apart as did the
vehicle. In the wagon was a miscellaneous collection
of scrap iron, broken pipes, pieces of
stoves, fractured pulleys and bent shafting mingling
in a confused mass. On the seat sat a
pleasant-faced, bright-looking youth, about Dick's
age, and nearly of his size.</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry!" called Dick. "What in the
world have you got there?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">8</a></span></p>

<p>"Scrap iron, scrap wagon and a scrap horse,"
replied Henry Darby, with a grin.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in a sort of new venture," was the
answer. "I'm collecting old iron, wherever I can
find it, and selling it again. I bought up a lot
out in the country, and I hired this rig to get it
back to town with; only I'm afraid I'm not going
to arrive."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, this horse&mdash;if you can call such an
animal a dignified name like that&mdash;has the
heaves, a spavin, spring-halt, blind-staggers, and
a few other things. It got tired a few minutes
ago, and went on a strike. I'm afraid to do anything
to it to make it go for fear it'll fall apart
right here in the road."</p>

<p>Dick, who had brought his steed to a stop,
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Well, you are in a fix," he said. "But I don't
understand about this old iron business."</p>

<p>"I've got to do something to make a living,"
answered Henry Darby, who seemed confused
about something. "I have been doing it on a small
scale for quite a while. Now I'm trying to
branch out a bit. There's money in old iron, if
I could sell enough of it. But I don't see how
I'm going to get this load home. You might
lend me your horse," he added with a laugh; for
in spite of the poverty of Henry Darby, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9">9</a></span>
wealth of Dick Hamilton, the two boys were good
friends.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't do that, Henry," said Dick;
and his voice showed that he was sincere. "The
fact is, I'm in a hurry to get home. When I
went out this morning father told me to be sure
to be in at three o'clock, as he had something
important to tell me."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's going to reduce your allowance,"
suggested Henry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No, I can't imagine what it is," and Dick spoke
soberly "But that it's important I know by the
way he acted. Otherwise I'd lend you my horse
to pull that load back with. I'll tell you what I'll
do, however. As soon as I get home I'll send one
of the grooms out here with one of the work
horses. They'll think that load is a feather. But
now I am in a hurry, so I must gallop on. It
won't do to keep dad waiting, especially when he
laid so much stress on my being home on time."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't trouble about a horse. I guess I
can get this&mdash;this animal to go after a while,"
and Henry laughed; for he was of a happy disposition,
and trouble rolled away from him "like
water off a duck's back," as he used to say.</p>

<p>"But it's no trouble at all," insisted Dick.
"You wait here and I'll send a man back with a
horse. You can drive him home to-morrow, or
to-night, if you like."</p>

<p>"All right. It's very kind of you," said Henry,
but Dick did not stay to listen to the thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10">10</a></span>
before he had called to Rex, under whose flying
feet the dust of the road arose in a cloud.</p>

<p>"He must be in a hurry to ride like that,"
thought Henry, as he tried to lead on his apology
for a horse. "I wonder what it is that his father
is going to tell him? It must be about money I
guess, for Mr. Hamilton has so much he doesn't
know what to do with all of it."</p>

<p>Dick was also wondering, as he galloped along,
what the important matter might be that his
parent was to speak to him about. He only had
a hint of it in what Mr. Hamilton had said that
morning.</p>

<p>"This is your birthday," Dick's father had
remarked, when he and his son were at breakfast
in the Hamilton mansion. "I wish you many
happy returns, and I will add that I have something
very important to say to you this afternoon&mdash;something
that may have a great influence
on your future life. I will meet you here in the
library at three o'clock, and communicate to you
certain portions of your dear mother's will."</p>

<p>For a moment emotion had overcame Mr.
Hamilton, for his wife, of whom he had been
devotedly fond, though dead some years, was
ever a living memory to him. Dick's eyes filled
with tears as he recalled the sweet-faced woman
to whom he had lisped "mother," for he was only
a small chap when she died.</p>

<p>"So, if you will be here on time, Dick," his
father finally went on, "I will read to you an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11">11</a></span>
important document, in accordance with your
mother's final instructions. Now don't be late.
I am a busy man, and if I make an appointment
for a certain time, I like the other fellow to be
there also," and he smiled at his son.</p>

<p>"I'll be there, father," promised Dick.</p>

<p>So now he was hurrying on to keep his appointment.
His home was about two miles from the
town of Hamilton Corners, in one of our eastern
states, the place having been named in honor of
Mr. Hamilton, who, as will be told later, was at
the head of many industries that gave the town
its importance.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it can all be about?" mused
Dick, as he turned his horse into the driveway
that led to the mansion.</p>

<p>In a vague way he knew that his mother had
been very wealthy in her own right; almost as
wealthy as Mr. Hamilton, who was many times
a millionaire. But Dick had no idea of the provisions
of his mother's will. He had often
heard his father speak of what a wise and far-seeing
woman Mrs. Hamilton was; but Dick,
who was a healthy, happy youth, fond of all
kinds of sports, had not up to this time given
much thought to the future.</p>

<p>Now, to-day, he was to be given a glimpse into
it, and he was not a little sobered by the thoughts
of the coming interview.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE WILL</h3>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to see you are on time, Dick,"
said Mr. Hamilton, as his son, having left Rex
at the stables, and sent one of the grooms on a
horse to the aid of Henry, entered the handsome
library. "Right to the minute. That is what I
like to see. It speaks well for what we have in
hand."</p>

<p>Dick had never known his father to be quite
so solemn save on one former occasion, and that
was the dreadful day when the house was dark
and in confusion, followed by a strange stillness,
and then his loving mother was seen no more.
She had gone away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;he did not
understand where until long afterward, and it
now made him a little sad to recall the scene.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were interrupted by a sudden
rush of feet, and a big bulldog, with fore
legs arched almost grotesquely, and with two big
teeth showing from under the upper lip, leaped
joyously upon him.</p>

<p>"Grit, old boy!" exclaimed Dick, as he caressed
the brute, handsome in its very ugliness, a dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13">13</a></span>
the look of which impressed strangers with fear
as to its temper, but which, to all friends, was as
gentle as a kitten. It was a fine specimen of the
bulldog, of good stock and very valuable.</p>

<p>"My son," began Mr. Hamilton, as he drew
from his pocket a folded paper, "I asked you to
meet me here to-day to listen to some of the provisions
of your dear, departed mother's will. I
have a copy of it, the original being on file at the
court house according to law. Soon after you
were born she had it drawn up, and, having told
me the nature of it, asked if I was satisfied. I
told her I was, absolutely.</p>

<p>"You may have heard, in a general way, that
your mother was very wealthy in her own right.
She was, more so than you have any idea of, perhaps.
It is not necessary to go into figures now,
but sufficient to say that her fortune was a very
large one, and that it can be counted in the
millions. Part of it was left her by her father,
and the rest accumulated through wise investments.</p>

<p>"In fact, your mother was a great believer in
wise and paying investments, as you will see.
She was worried lest her only son, when he grew
up, would not appreciate the value of money; nor
understand how much good can be done with it.</p>

<p>"Therefore, in order to make sure that you
would not do as so many rich youths have done&mdash;wasted
the wealth left to them&mdash;she has seen
fit to make certain provisions and restrictions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">14</a></span>
You are to inherit her great wealth&mdash;if you fulfill
these conditions."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Dick, who was not a
little impressed by what his father had said.
"Down, Grit, down," he commanded gently, for
the dog was trying to clamber all over its master,
so glad was it to see Dick. "Down, Grit," and
the noble animal obeyed, crouching at the youth's
feet, but ever keeping a watchful eye on his face,
ready to begin the demonstration again at the
first sign of encouragement.</p>

<p>"You are to inherit your mother's wealth on
this condition, among others," went on Mr. Hamilton.
"Beginning with this, your birthday,
which is the time she set, you are to be supplied
with a large amount of cash. You are to be
allowed to spend it as you please, when you
please, and for what you please, subject, of course,
to certain common-sense restrictions, of which I
am to be the judge."</p>

<p>"Does that mean I'll have all the money I want
to spend just as I please?" asked Dick joyfully.</p>

<p>"Practically so. But here is the restriction:
You are required to make, within one year from
date, one wise and paying investment with some
of the money you spend. It may be a large one
or it may be a small one, but at the end of the
year it must show a respectable profit."</p>

<p>"And if it doesn't?"</p>

<p>"Then you will lose considerable," went on Mr.
Hamilton. "In the event of your failure to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">15</a></span>
such an investment within twelve months your
mother's fortune will be tied up so that you can
not touch it, or derive any benefit from it, for a
certain period, which will be disclosed later."</p>

<p>"Does that mean I will have to be&mdash;be poor?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly poor, but you will have to
put up with a good deal less than you have now.
You see, your mother's idea was to have you avoid
the pitfalls and snares into which fall many
wealthy youths with millionaire parents. She
wanted to make you appreciate the value of
money, to know how to spend it, and to learn,
above everything else, that money begets money.</p>

<p>"That is why she made such a peculiar will,
and, I think, she did wisely. So, for a year, at
least, you are to live as do other millionaires' sons
who are older. In fact, you are to have more
money to spend than you ever had before, for,
though I have been liberal with you, I wanted you
to have something still better to look forward to.
So, now, your fortune is your own to make.</p>

<p>"If you devote some of the money you are to
have to a wise and paying investment, you will,
comparatively soon, come into possession of your
mother's vast wealth, though, of course, the
executors of the will, of whom I am one, are to
have certain control over you. You have twelve
months from to-day in which to make your try,
Dick, my boy."</p>

<p>"A year to make money out of money. But
how, father? I have no knowledge of business."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just it. You must gain some knowledge
of business or you will never be able to
take care of your fortune. That is one reason
your mother made such a will. I need not say I
hope you will be successful. I shall aid you all
I can, but I would rather you relied on yourself.
I had to do it when I was your age, and I see no
reason why you should not take some responsibility."</p>

<p>"Are these all the restrictions?" asked Dick,
his mind somewhat confused by the sudden news.</p>

<p>"No, not all. There are a number of provisions
of the will, governing your future life,
aside from the matter of the investment. I will
not read them to you now, but as soon as the
occasion arises you will be made acquainted with
them."</p>

<p>"And can I start in and have the money at
once? I know a lot of things I want." Dick
was walking about excitedly. He had visions of
a big automobile and a fine motor boat, two
things his father, up to the present, had not
allowed him to own.</p>

<p>"One of the provisions of the will," went on
Mr. Hamilton, "is that on this date there is to be
placed a large sum to your credit in the local
national bank, of which you know I am president.
You will be given a check book and allowed to
draw upon it as you please, subject, as I said
before, to certain reasonable restrictions on my
part."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the check book?" asked Dick. "I've
always wanted to have one."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," continued his father, with a
smile. "You must first go to the bank and be
identified by the proper officials, and also leave
your signature there. Then you shall have the
check book, Dick. But there is another matter,"
and Mr. Hamilton turned to the second page of
the document in his hand.</p>

<p>Dick's heart sank. Perhaps, after all, he was
not to have the wealth with which his imagination
was already building fairy castles in the air.</p>

<p>"In case you fail to make this paying investment,"
went on Mr. Hamilton, "not only do you
lose control of the money for a long time, but
you have to undergo a sort of penance. It is
this. You will have to go and live with your
Uncle Ezra Larabee at Dankville&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Ezra!" exclaimed Dick, and his face
fell.</p>

<p>"Yes, your Uncle Ezra and Aunt Samanthy.
You will have to remain in their charge for a
certain period and attend any boarding school
they may select for you. That is done to teach
you the value of money, and I think, from what
I know of your Uncle Ezra, it will be a good
place to learn," and Mr. Hamilton smiled rather
grimly.</p>

<p>"In order that you may fully appreciate the
situation, your mother has provided," proceeded
Dick's father, "that you are to spend a week with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">18</a></span>
your Uncle Ezra, beginning to-morrow. Her
idea was that you should get better acquainted
with her only brother, who, as you may have
heard, is quite well off, and one of the wisest men
in the matter of money I ever met. He is very
conservative about investments, but he makes
them pay. Your dear mother thought it would
be a good school for you, and I have no doubt
but what you will see that for yourself if you
spend a week with him. If you should not be
able, in the year, to make the paying investment,
you will, of course, pass under the control of Mr.
Larabee.</p>

<p>"I think I have now told you enough for the
present. As I said, there are other provisions in
the will regarding you, but we can discuss them
when the time comes. I have written to your
uncle, and he expects you to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Now, Dick, my son, having gotten this somewhat
sad business over&mdash;for it makes me sad to
recall your dear mother, and the careful way she
made provision that you should grow up to be a
wise and good man&mdash;I think we will have a little
lunch. I am hungry and I think you are, so I
arranged a little birthday dinner for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton led the way to the large dining
room, where, upon the mahogany table, cut glass
and silver sparkled in profusion. There were
places for two and, as soon as father and son
entered, a solemn butler rang a chiming bell, and
servants brought in a dainty but bountiful meal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Roast duck!" exclaimed Dick, as he caught
sight of it. "That's like you, dad, to remember
how fond I am of it. And I'll bet he's ordered
frozen pudding for dessert; hasn't he, Mary?"
turning to the smiling maid who was arranging
some dishes on the sideboard.</p>

<p>"That he has, Master Dick," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I'd give you a good meal
before you went to Uncle Ezra's house," said Mr.
Hamilton, with a queer smile. "You may not
get&mdash;But there, Dick, I wish you all the luck in
the world, and may we both be as happy on your
next birthday," and Mr. Hamilton stood up and
gravely shook hands with his son.</p>

<p>"Um," murmured Dick. "Maybe I'll be at
Uncle Ezra's a year from now&mdash;if I don't make
that paying investment. I wonder what sort of
a place he has, anyhow? Well, there's no use
worrying now. I must take some of that roast
duck while it's hot," and he began to investigate
his well-filled plate with no little interest.</p>

<p>"You leave for your uncle's on the eight o'clock
train to-morrow morning," said Mr. Hamilton.
"Have your things all packed to-night, and don't
be late, for your uncle is a very particular man&mdash;a&mdash;very&mdash;particular&mdash;man,"
and again that grim
smile came over Mr. Hamilton's face; a smile
which puzzled Dick. But he was to know the
meaning of it soon enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>UNCLE EZRA THREATENS</h3>

<p>Dick had not paid a visit to his Uncle Ezra
since he could remember. He dimly recalled being
there when a small boy, and had a hazy
memory of a fine big house, but very gloomy,
standing in the midst of large grounds that
seemed more like a cemetery than anything else.
Of his uncle and aunt he had but a faint recollection,
and when he stood on the depot platform
the next morning, waiting for his train, he was
in no very happy frame of mind.</p>

<p>For Dick liked fun, and jolly companions, and
did not relish being sent off to visit relatives who
were almost strangers to him, even though Mr.
Larabee was his mother's only brother.</p>

<p>"I don't fancy I'm going to have a very good
time," mused the youth, as the train was whizzing
him along toward Dankville. "Still, I'm
going to fulfill the conditions of the will as far
as I can. Make a paying investment, eh? I
wonder if I can do it? But, of course, I can. I'll
buy some building lots, stocks or bonds, and sell
'em at a profit. I'll do it as soon as I get home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21">21</a></span>
and then I'll not have to worry about the matter
any more," he added lightly, as if making money
was the easiest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Dankville was a country village about a hundred
miles from Hamilton Corners. When Dick
alighted at the station he looked around in some
surprise. The place seemed to be absolutely
deserted. There was no one in sight but the
station agent, and, as soon as the train pulled
out, he disappeared into his office.</p>

<p>"Not a very pleasant reception," mused Dick,
as he sat down on the upturned end of his dress-suit
case. "Not exactly a brass band out to meet
me. I wonder how I get to Uncle Ezra's place?
Guess I'll ask the man."</p>

<p>He started toward the ticket office, but, as he
approached it, he saw a carriage driving up to the
platform. In the vehicle sat an elderly man with
a little tuft of white chin whiskers, which moved
to and fro in a curious manner every time he
spoke to the horse, which was frequently necessary,
as the animal seemed to need much urging
to induce it to continue its journey.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" exclaimed the man, though there was
no occasion for the command, as the horse was
glad enough to stop. "Are you Richard Hamilton,
son of Mortimer Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"I'm Dick. Are you Uncle Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Dick!" fairly snorted the elderly man.
"You're Richard, that's what you were christened
and that's what you must be called! I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">22</a></span>
abide nicknames and I won't have 'em. You're
Richard, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Dick, meekly enough,
though there was an angry light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Richard, you've come to visit us
for a certain purpose," went on his uncle. "What
it is we needn't discuss now. The train was a
little ahead of time or I'd been here sooner."
Mr. Larabee did not seem to think that he might
be a little late. "I always make it a point to be
on time," he added. "Now, jump in. Your aunt
has a meal ready and she musn't be kept waiting.
I want you to understand from the start that
everything is done on time in my house. We rise
at a certain hour, and we have our meals at certain
hours. Folks that come to see us have to do
as we do or they don't get any meals. I hope you
understand that."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Dick, his heart sinking down
deeper than ever. It was worse than he had
thought. Still the idea of a meal, after his long
ride, seemed good.</p>

<p>Mr. Larabee's fine country home was considered
one of the best places in that part of the
state. There was not a crooked fence on it, the
gravel walks were as trim as though no one had
ever stepped on their surface, and the grass was
always cut to a certain length. The house was
always painted at a certain time of the year, as
were also the barns, and the place looked almost
like a picture in a book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">23</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, Mr. Larabee's neighbors used to say he
never took any pleasure in it, as he was always
so busy looking to see if a stick or a stone had not
become misplaced, or if the paint on the house or
barn was not chipping off.</p>

<p>"So this is Nephew Richard, is it?" asked a
small, prim, rather thin-faced woman, as she
came to the door when the carriage containing
Dick and his uncle drove up the path. "I'm glad
to see you, Nephew Richard," she went on,
extending a cold and clammy hand, and giving
Dick a little peck that seemed more like a nip
from a bird than a kiss.</p>

<p>"Is dinner ready?" asked Mr. Larabee.</p>

<p>"You know it is, Ezra," replied his wife. "I'll
serve it as soon as you put the horse up. Come
in, Nephew Richard, but be sure and wipe your
feet."</p>

<p>She watched Dick while he scraped off an
invisible quantity of dust from his shoes that
had scarcely touched the ground that morning.
After giving them what he thought was a good
polishing on the mat, he started to enter the front
hall.</p>

<p>"Wait!" almost screamed his aunt. "There's
a little mud on that left heel!"</p>

<p>Dick obligingly gave it another scrape on the
mat and started in.</p>

<p>"One moment, Nephew Richard," said Mrs.
Larabee, in almost imploring accents. "Let me
wipe your satchel off before you go in. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">24</a></span>
afraid it's dusty from the drive, and I can't bear
dust in my house."</p>

<p>She kept Dick waiting on the front steps while
she went in and got a cloth, with which she carefully
wiped off the dress-suit case, though Dick
did not see how there could be any dust on it,
as it had been covered with the lap robe all the
way.</p>

<p>"Now you may come in," Aunt Samantha said,
as graciously as was possible. "Welcome to The
Firs. We call our place The Firs," she went on,
"because there are so many fir trees around it.
It makes it dark and keeps the flies out."</p>

<p>It certainly made it dark, for as Dick entered
the hall he could hardly see, and had to proceed
by the sense of feeling.</p>

<p>"We never open this part of the house, except
for company," Mrs. Larabee went on. "Ezra
and I use the back door, as it saves wear and tear.
Now, if you'll come with me, I'll show you to
your room and you can take off your good
clothes and put on a rough suit."</p>

<p>"I haven't any rougher suit than this," said
Dick, looking at the garments he wore. "I've
got another suit in the case, but it's newer than
this."</p>

<p>"Mercy, child!" exclaimed his aunt. "Would
you wear such clothes around every day?"</p>

<p>"I always have," replied Dick simply.</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard tell the like of that!
What does your father&mdash;but, there, I forgot. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">25</a></span>
know Mortimer Hamilton. He doesn't care how
he throws money away!"</p>

<p>"My father never throws money away!" exclaimed
Dick, always ready to champion his parent.
"He thinks it pays to buy good clothes, as
they wear better than cheap ones."</p>

<p>"Such wastefulness," sighed the aunt, as she
led the way upstairs. "But it's no use talking.
However, if you come to live here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence, but Dick registered
a mental vow that it would be a long day
before he would voluntarily come to live at The
Firs.</p>

<p>He was shown into a small room, plainly
furnished, containing a small cot bed.</p>

<p>"As you are only to stay a week, I thought it
would make less work for me if you had this
room," said Mrs. Larabee. "It used to be the
servant's, but I don't keep any now. They are
too expensive. Now be very careful. Always
take your shoes off when you come upstairs, as I
can't be always cleaning and dusting. Don't
throw your things around, and keep the shutters
closed so the flies won't get in. When you are
ready come down to dinner."</p>

<p>"Well, if this doesn't get me!" exclaimed Dick,
when his aunt had left him alone and he had
dropped down on the edge of the cot. "This
certainly is the limit. If I didn't know differently
I'd say Uncle Ezra had lost all his money. I
guess he's got it salted down and hates to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26">26</a></span>
it out of the brine. Well, I'll see what they have
for dinner before I make up my mind any
further."</p>

<p>The meal, though plain, was good, and to a
boy with Dick's appetite, nothing came amiss.
But it was small pleasure to dine when two pair
of eyes were almost constantly watching him.</p>

<p>"Don't get any of the gravy on the table cloth,"
cautioned Mrs. Larabee. "It was clean this week,
and I don't want to have to put another one on
before Sunday."</p>

<p>Dick felt a guilty flush come over his face as
he saw that he had dropped a small piece of butter
on the cloth. But he thought it wisest to say
nothing.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to eat that crust of bread?"
asked his uncle, as Dick laid aside a portion that
was burned black.</p>

<p>"It's a little too&mdash;too brown," replied the boy,
who did not fancy burned bread.</p>

<p>"That makes it all the better," said Mr. Larabee.
"Bread should be well cooked to be digestible.
Always eat your crusts. 'Sinful waste
makes woeful want,' as the proverb says. I had
to eat my crusts when I was young."</p>

<p>Dick managed to get it down, and the meal
finally came to a close. He felt considerably
better after it, and when his uncle proposed a
walk around the place, he was ready to accompany
Mr. Larabee.</p>

<p>Dick found much to admire in the well-kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">27</a></span>
grounds. Several men were at work, and the
manner in which they hastened with their tasks
when their employer approached spoke volumes
for the way in which they regarded him.</p>

<p>Dick paused in the stable to admire the horses,
of which his uncle kept several. Without thinking
he pulled a wisp of hay from a bale and
offered it to one of the animals.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" exclaimed his uncle sharply.
"You'll scatter it all over the barn. The man has
just swept the place up, and I don't like a litter of
dirt around."</p>

<p>He stopped to pick up some pieces of hay Dick
had inadvertently dropped, and looked so cross
that the boy wished he had kept out of the stable.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Larabee seemed a bit ashamed
of himself a little later, for he showed Dick where
he could find some withered apples to feed to the
pigs.</p>

<p>"Only don't scatter 'em on the ground," he
cautioned. "I hate to see apples thrown about. I
keep a man to look after the orchard, and I like
it nice and tidy."</p>

<p>Now Dick was not a careless youth, but he
thought this was carrying things a little too far.
However, he brightened up a bit when his uncle
announced that he had to leave his nephew to his
own devices for a time, as he had some duties
to attend to.</p>

<p>Dick managed to while away the afternoon
looking at the sights around the place, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">28</a></span>
uncle had a large farm, though he was wealthy
enough not to need the income from it. Still he
was the kind of a man who can not own the
smallest bit of land without putting it to some
use.</p>

<p>Dick looked about for a sight of some lads of
his own age with whom he might become acquainted
and enjoy his enforced visit to Dankville,
but boys seemed a scarce article around
The Firs.</p>

<p>He strolled back to the house, and, not seeing
his aunt about, and being desirous of exploring
the rather stately mansion, he started on a
tour of it. Through the darkened hall he went
until he came to what he thought would be the
parlor. He opened the door, though it creaked
on rusty hinges.</p>

<p>The room was so dark he could see nothing,
and, having heard his father say that there were
some choice oil paintings at The Firs, he opened
a window to get light enough to view them. He
had a hard task, as it seemed the sash and shutters
had not been moved since they were built,
but finally a stream of light entered the gloomy
apartment, with the horse-hair furniture arranged
stiffly against the wall.</p>

<p>Dick caught sight of a large painting and was
going closer to examine it when he heard a
shriek in the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes, Richard! Whatever have you
done?" he heard his aunt call.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I just opened a window to let some light
in, so I could see the pictures," he answered.</p>

<p>"Light? In this room? Why, Richard Hamilton!
This room hasn't been opened in years!
We never think of letting light in the parlor. The
carpet might fade. Oh, Richard, I am so sorry!
If I thought you would have opened a window
I would have locked the door. Shut it and come
out at once! Mercy sakes!"</p>

<p>Much abashed, Dick closed the shutters and
window and walked out. His aunt ran and got
a broom, with which she brushed the carpet where
he had stepped, though how she could see any
dust in that gloom was more than the boy could
understand.</p>

<p>"Never, never go in there again," cautioned his
aunt. "We never open that room except&mdash;for
funerals."</p>

<p>"I guess that's all it's good for," thought Dick.</p>

<p>He sat around, very miserable, the remainder
of the afternoon, and had little appetite for supper,
which was rather a scant meal; some preserves,
bread and weak tea making up the repast.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a stroll to the village," remarked
the youth, as he arose from the table.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked his aunt, as if she had not
heard aright.</p>

<p>"To the village. I'd like to see what's going
on."</p>

<p>"There's nothing going on," replied his uncle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">30</a></span>
"The village is five miles from here. Besides, we
go to bed early, and I don't allow any one in my
house, visitor or otherwise, to come in with a
latch key. You'd better stay here, read some
good book to improve your mind, and retire early.
That's what I do, and I find it pays."</p>

<p>Dick groaned. He now knew the meaning of
his father's queer smile.</p>

<p>"Then I'll walk around outside the house for a
while to get some air," proposed Dick.</p>

<p>"I'd rather you wouldn't," came from Mr.
Larabee, as he squirmed uneasily in his chair.
"The gravel walks have just been raked smooth,
and I hate to have 'em disturbed."</p>

<p>Dick did not answer, but sat in his chair
silently, while his aunt cleared off the supper
table. When the lamps were lighted, which was
not done until it was quite dark, Mr. Larabee
handed Dick a book. The boy hoped it might
be some tale of adventures that would help pass
away the hours, but on looking at the title he
saw it was "Pilgrim's Progress."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go to bed," he announced, and his
aunt and uncle gave an audible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The next morning Dick, without saying anything
to Mr. or Mrs. Larabee, walked to the railroad
station. There he sent a telegram to his
father. It read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dear Dad. This place is fierce. Can't I come
home? Wire me quick."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">31</a></span></p>

<p>He said he would wait at the station for an
answer, and he was a little sorry when it came,
as it meant he would have to go back to the dismal
house. His father's reply was:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dear Dick. To fulfill the conditions you must
remain a week. Do the best you can and let it
be a lesson to you."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Be a lesson to me?" mused Dick. "Oh, I
see! He means I must make that investment so
I won't have to come here and live."</p>

<p>On his return Dick entered the house at the
rear door, pausing momentarily to wipe his feet.
But his aunt was watching for him.</p>

<p>"Richard," she said severely. "They're not
half clean. I can see dirt on them."</p>

<p>"Oh," he began, but he kept silent, and, instead
of entering, turned into the orchard. There, at
least, he would not be corrected. His uncle found
him there a little later, as Dick was sitting idly
under a tree.</p>

<p>"Haven't you anything to occupy yourself
with?" asked Mr. Larabee severely.</p>

<p>"No," answered Dick. "There's no one to get
up a baseball game with around here, as far as I
can see."</p>

<p>"Boys shouldn't always be playing," commented
Mr. Larabee. "You should labor to
improve your mind. Why don't you read that
book I gave you last night?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care for it."</p>

<p>"That's the way with the rising generation.
Frivolous! frivolous!"</p>

<p>"School has closed for the term," said Dick.
"I'm done with studying, and that book looked
as if it was to be studied."</p>

<p>"It was," replied his uncle. "It merits being
well studied. But it's what I expected of you.
It's the way that you have been brought up."</p>

<p>"I guess my father brought me up in the way
he thought best," fired back Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, his way is very different from mine&mdash;very
different," and Mr. Larabee shook his head
as though to indicate that a great mistake had
been made. "Then there's your mother's will,"
he went on. "The idea of leaving that big fortune
to a boy like you. It's wicked! It's a terrible
risk! A terrible risk! What a foolish
woman she was! But then it's all you can expect
of a woman!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Uncle Ezra!" exclaimed Dick,
rising to his feet, his brown eyes sparkling in a
dangerous way, and a red flush showing on his
cheeks. "I don't want you to speak that way of
my mother!"</p>

<p>"She was my sister, and I say she made a foolish
will!" stormed the old man.</p>

<p>"She was my mother!" replied Dick hotly,
"and I'll not have her spoken of in that way!
She knew what she was doing! She was the best
woman that ever lived and&mdash;and much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">33</a></span>
than you are with your ideas of what is good.
You musn't speak so of her! I'll not stand it!"</p>

<p>"Look here, young man!" exclaimed Mr. Larabee.
"I guess you forget who you're talking to."</p>

<p>"No, I don't!"</p>

<p>"I won't have such language used toward me.
I say your mother made a foolish will, and I
know what I'm talking about."</p>

<p>"If you say that again I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;" and then
Dick paused. After all this man was his mother's
brother, and he knew how his parent would have
gently reproved him had she been alive. The
memory of her took all the hard feeling out of
his heart.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I spoke so hastily, Uncle Ezra," he
said in a low voice. "But I can't bear to have my
mother referred to in that way. I think she did
what was right, and I know my father does also."</p>

<p>"Humph, little he knows about it," snorted Mr.
Larabee. "Just you wait until you come under
my care, young man, and I'll show you what's
what! I'll teach you how to behave to your
elders," and, in great indignation, the old man
trudged off.</p>

<p>Dick started. He had, for the moment, forgotten
that portion of his mother's will which,
under certain conditions, would compel him to
live with his uncle and aunt.</p>

<p>"Live with them?" thought the boy. "Go to a
boarding school they might select? Not much!
I must make some kind of a paying investment
within a year, if only to escape their clutches!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>DICK BECOMES CELEBRATED</h3>

<p>Dick managed to live through the week at his
uncle's place, but it was hard work. He was corrected
from morning until night. Almost everything
he did while in the house, if it was only to
pick up a book in the hope of finding something
to read, met with a reproof from Aunt Samantha.</p>

<p>"Don't do that," she would say. "You'll make
the dust fly about if you disturb the books, and I
can't abide dust."</p>

<p>If he wandered about the grounds his uncle
would covertly watch him.</p>

<p>"Don't pick up stones to throw," Mr. Larabee
would caution the lad. "You might break a
window, or take the bark off my favorite apple
trees. I never saw such a boy! Why can't you
sit still and think? I'm sure you've got enough
responsibilities hanging over you, with all that
money your mother so foolishly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he had the sense to stop there, for the
angry flash in Dick's brown eyes warned him this
was a subject he had better not mention to his
nephew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35">35</a></span></p>

<p>There was never a more happy boy than Dick
when the week of probation was up and he could
start for home.</p>

<p>"You are going back to that wasteful life of
idleness," said his aunt, as she condescended to
shake hands with him, and give him her little
bird-like kiss. "I hope your visit here has done
you good. You may make us a longer one&mdash;some
day."</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it," thought Dick to himself.</p>

<p>"Come, now," grumbled Uncle Ezra. "I don't
want to keep the horse out of the stable any
longer than I can help. He might take cold and
I'd have to buy some medicine. Saving money
is like earning it, as I hope you'll learn, Nephew
Richard. I'll teach it to you when you come
under my control, as I'm sure you will, for you
never can comply with the task your mother so
foolishly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick's hands clinched, and it was lucky that
at that moment the horse shied at a piece of
paper, requiring all Mr. Larabee's attention to
control him, or there might have been a renewal
of the quarrel.</p>

<p>Dick breathed a sigh of relief as the gloomy
house in the midst of the fir trees was left behind,
and he gave vent to an audible exclamation
of satisfaction when he was in the train and
speeding away from Dankville, for even the
name of the place seemed to have an unhappy
influence over him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, are you glad to get back?" asked Mr.
Hamilton, as he greeted his son that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Glad, father? Say, give me some of that
money, quick! I want to make that paying investment.
I never could stand it at The Firs!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, in spite of his queer ways, your Uncle
Ezra is a man of sterling character," he said.
"He is as true as steel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And just about as hard," interrupted Dick,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"But now to business," went on Mr. Hamilton.
"I have deposited a large sum to your credit in
our bank, and if you will come downtown with
me now I'll introduce you to the cashier and see
that you get a check book. Then&mdash;well, the
world is before you, and it's yours&mdash;to conquer
or be conquered by."</p>

<p>On their way to the bank father and son were
greeted by many acquaintances, for Mr. Hamilton
was a person of great importance in Hamilton
Corners. The town was a good-sized one, situated
on the shore of Lake Dunkirk, a large body
of water. Mr. Hamilton, besides being president
of the Hamilton National Bank, was vice-president
of the Hamilton Trust Company, and owned
a stone quarry, a brass foundry, large woolen
mills, and a lumber concern, all in the town or
its immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>He was also a director of the Hamilton, Dorchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">37</a></span>
and Hatfield Railroad, which ran through
the town, and president of the Hamilton Trolley
Company. These were all sources of Mr. Hamilton's
wealth, and, as he employed many men in
the various industries, which he controlled or was
interested in, he was regarded as the most
important man in the place.</p>

<p>But this did not make him overbearing in
character. In fact, he was a very kind man,
always ready to help the poor, and as he had begun
as a poor boy and made his money by hard
work, he had a great sympathy for those not so
well off in this world's goods.</p>

<p>Dick took after his father. Though surrounded
by wealth all his life, and accustomed to
luxury, he was a lad of democratic spirit. He
cared little for money in itself, though he appreciated
what could be done with it, and he was
always willing to use what he had for the benefit
or pleasure of himself and his friends. He was
ambitious in no small degree, and anxious to
succeed in whatever he undertook.</p>

<p>It did not take long to get through with the
formalities at the bank, and Dick's eyes sparkled
when he saw the substantial balance to his credit.
He took the little red check book with an air as
though he had used one all his life, put it into his
pocket, and, nodding to his father, walked out.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Hamilton, with a little
sigh, "I hope money doesn't spoil him, for he is
a fine lad. But I guess the remembrance of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">38</a></span>
Uncle Ezra may have a large influence on what
he does."</p>

<p>The first person Dick met on emerging from
the bank was Henry Darby. He hailed the poorer
lad.</p>

<p>"Well, Henry, did you get that load of iron
home safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I sold it the next day. I'm much
obliged to you for sending that horse. I couldn't
get the one I hired from the man, of whom I
bought the iron, to go another step. I'd have
been there all night if it hadn't been for you."</p>

<p>"That's all right. The next time I meet you
in a fix like that I'll tow you home myself."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm going to get an automobile."</p>

<p>"An automobile?" and Henry's eyes opened as
wide as possible. The machines were rarely seen
in Hamilton Corners.</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, Henry, I've come into some
property, and I can spend as much money as I
like&mdash;of course, not waste it. I've always
wanted an auto, and I'm going to get one. I'm
going for it now."</p>

<p>"Whew, I wish I was you," exclaimed Henry,
with a sigh, as he started down the street after
some more old iron he had heard was for sale.</p>

<p>Henry was an energetic lad, always looking for
a chance to make money. He lived with his
father, who was never called anything else than
"Hank" Darby, and who was known as the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">39</a></span>
"shiftless" man in town. Mr. Darby was
always talking of big schemes he was going to
put into operation as soon as he could command
the capital, but he never got the money. As a
consequence he never did anything, but lived off
what his son earned.</p>

<p>Dick had decided that his first purchase with
his new wealth should be an automobile. He
wanted to get a big touring car, but his father
suggested that he had better start with a runabout.</p>

<p>"It will be less expensive if you have a smash-up
learning how to run it," counseled Mr. Hamilton,
and Dick wisely agreed with him.</p>

<p>"When I get my car I'll take a run about the
country and see what sort of an investment I'll
make," said Dick. "I may want to go in for real
estate. There's money in that, isn't there, dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you buy right and sell right. But that
business is like everything else, you've got to
learn it. However, you are your own master to
a certain extent. Good luck to you."</p>

<p>Dick went to a neighboring city that same
afternoon and purchased his runabout. He
wanted to drive it home alone, but the manager
of the garage sent a helper with the boy. But the
man did not have much to do, for Dick was very
quick and soon learned the different points. In a
few days he was able to operate the machine with
considerable skill, and he took a number of his
boy friends for a spin in the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"Want to take a trip?" he called one afternoon
to Simon Scardale and Guy Fletcher, whom he
saw in front of the billiard room, which place they
seemed to frequent very much of late.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Simon. "Maybe we can get a
race with some car along the road. That will be
sport."</p>

<p>"Not for me," replied Dick quietly. "I sha'n't
race until I know the car better. But come
along."</p>

<p>In spite of their rather flashy manners, Dick
liked Simon and Guy, as he did nearly everyone,
in fact&mdash;for Dick Hamilton was a large-hearted
youth. He accepted all his acquaintances "at
one hundred cents on the dollar" until he learned
to value them differently.</p>

<p>The three boys spent a pleasant time whirring
about on the country roads.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that property?" asked
Dick at length, pointing to a low, swampy tract.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Guy. "Thinking of buying it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied Dick. "I have a chance to
get it cheap. Do you think I could sell it again?"</p>

<p>"Search me," answered Simon. "It looks to
be good for ducks, that's all."</p>

<p>"It only needs draining," objected Dick. "I
think it would be a good investment, and I came
out here to look at it."</p>

<p>"Going into business?" asked Guy, with a
sneer. "I thought you didn't have to work."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm going into business, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">41</a></span>
I finish at school," said Dick, for the term at the
academy, where he attended, had recently closed.
"I've come into some money lately," he said modestly,
for he had not spoken of his fortune to any
one yet, "and I want to invest some of my spare
cash."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the very thing!" exclaimed Simon.
"I know a stock that's bound to go up ten points
in a few days."</p>

<p>"No stocks or bonds for me until I know a little
more about them," objected Dick.</p>

<p>"But this is a sure thing," insisted Simon. "I
got a tip on it from a friend in New York."</p>

<p>"I've read of too many 'sure things' going
wrong," said Dick with a laugh. "I think I'll try
real estate for a starter."</p>

<p>Simon looked a little disappointed, but he made
up his mind he would try Dick again on that
subject, and a strange, cunning look came into his
face.</p>

<p>During the trip back Simon tried to learn from
the millionaire's son more about his new wealth,
but Dick did not give him much satisfaction.
However, Simon was sharp, and by dint of skillful
hints and questions learned more than Dick
thought he had told. Guy, too, was much interested,
and a visible change came over his manner.</p>

<p>Guy's father, Peter Fletcher, was president of
the Hamilton Trust Company, and, though Mr.
Hamilton owned most of the stock of the concern,
and had only placed Mr. Fletcher at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">42</a></span>
head of the institution for business reasons, Guy
gave himself as many airs as though his father
owned the bank. Learning that Dick had come
into possession of some wealth on his own
account, though he did not know the source, Guy
was somewhat inclined to toady to the youth with
whom he was on more or less friendly terms.</p>

<p>It was two days after this, when the evening
papers arrived in Hamilton Corners, that a mild
sensation was created. There, on the front
pages, was what purported to be a picture of
Dick Hamilton, while under it was the caption, in
big letters:</p>

<h3>THE MILLIONAIRE YOUTH.</h3>

<p>Then followed a garbled, but fairly correct, account
of how Dick, through the will of his mother,
had come into possession of fabulous wealth. Of
course the figure was put much higher than it
really was. In fact, no one but Mr. Hamilton
was aware of the exact amount, but this did not
stop the writer of the article from guessing at it.</p>

<p>Dick was described as a modern King Midas,
and he was credited with sleeping in an ivory bed
and eating off of gold plates and the rarest of cut
glass. Nothing was said about the peculiar provisions
of the will regarding the investment he
was to make; but the boundless opportunities open
to a youth with unlimited wealth at his disposal
were all pointed out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if that isn't the limit!" exclaimed Dick,
when he saw the paper. "I wonder who did it?"</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had asked Simon Scardale that
question that youth might have been confused,
but Dick never thought of it.</p>

<p>"It certainly is very unpleasant notoriety," remarked
Mr. Hamilton, "but you'll have to put up
with it. You are a sort of ward of the public
now, and the newspapers think they have a proprietary
interest in you. I have been through it
all, and so has nearly every other person of
wealth. The best way is to pay no attention to
it, and to treat with courtesy any newspaper men
who may wish to interview you. They have a
hard enough life, and if our doings, to a certain
extent, interest them, why I, for one, am willing
to oblige them as far as I can. I suppose the
transferring to your name of some stocks and
bonds, that were your mother's, has started this
piece of news. Well, you have achieved a certain
degree of fame, Dick, my boy."</p>

<p>And Dick found this out to his cost. The article
in one paper was followed by others in various
journals, until Dick's wealth had been made the
comment of newspaper reporters and editors in
many cities. But, through it all the youth kept a
level head.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">44</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>DICK AIDS HENRY</h3>

<p>"Where are you going to-day, Dick?" asked
Mr. Hamilton after breakfast one morning.</p>

<p>"I thought of taking a run in my car. I've
bought that property I was telling you about. I
think it will be a good investment, and it only
took five hundred dollars to secure it. I talked
to the agent, and he said I was sure to be able to
sell it for a thousand at the end of the year."</p>

<p>"Humph! Well&mdash;er&mdash;of course, you can't believe
all that a real-estate agent says, Dick."</p>

<p>"No, of course. I'm making allowances for
that, and I figure that it ought to be worth at
least eight hundred a year from now. That will
clear me three hundred."</p>

<p>"Well, you can do as you like about it. By the
way, I had a visit at the bank yesterday from an
agent for a motor boat concern. He said you had
ordered a boat from them, and he wanted to know
if it was all right."</p>

<p>"I did, dad. I've always wanted one. I hope
you told him it was all right."</p>

<p>"I told him to see you about it. I have no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45">45</a></span>
to you purchasing one of the craft. Only
be careful when you go out on the lake. There
are sudden storms on it, and you might be in
danger."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful, dad. I guess I'll just run over
to the motor boat place in my car and see if the
boat is ready to deliver. They had to order one
from the factory for me."</p>

<p>As Dick was riding through the town at an
easy pace he passed a rather dilapidated looking
house, in front of which stood a youth, at the
sight of whom Dick called:</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry! Want a ride?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Dick," was Henry Darby's answer.
"But I can't go."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the millionaire's son, as he
brought his runabout to a stop.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm engaged in a little business deal, and
I'm so bothered over it that I wouldn't enjoy a
ride. Besides, I have to go see a man."</p>

<p>"What's the business about, Henry? That
same old iron?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"But what are you bothered about?"</p>

<p>"Well, the truth is I have a chance to get hold
of a lot of scrap at a very low figure. But the
trouble is I must pay cash for it. I looked at it
the other day, and told the man I'd take it. I
figured then on having the money. Now I find
I haven't got it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you lose it?"</p>

<p>"No," and Henry spoke hesitatingly. "But you
see my father had an idea he could make some
money by becoming agent for a new kind of soap.
He borrowed my cash and sent for a big supply;
but when he got it no one would buy it. So he
has it on hand, and my money is gone. Of course
what I have is my father's until I'm of age,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Henry stopped. In spite of the selfish and
lazy character of his parent he was not going to
utter any complaint against him.</p>

<p>"How much money do you need to buy this
iron?" asked Dick, a sudden resolve coming into
his mind.</p>

<p>"It will take fifty dollars; but it might just as
well be five hundred as far as I'm concerned. I
could get it together in about a month, but it's out
of the question now. I'm just on my way to tell
the man I can't take the iron. It's too bad, as it's
a bargain, and I could easily make considerable on
the deal."</p>

<p>While Henry was speaking Dick had drawn a
little red book from his pocket, and was busily
writing in it with a fountain pen. He tore out a
slip of paper and handed it to his friend.</p>

<p>"There, Henry," he said, "if you take that to
the Hamilton National Bank they'll give you cash
for it."</p>

<p>"But what is it&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;a check
for fifty dollars!" exclaimed the other youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what it is," replied Dick smiling. "It's
a present from me, Henry."</p>

<p>"A present! I'm sorry, but I can't take it,
Dick. I'm very much obliged to you, but it
wouldn't be business, you know. I don't want
anything I don't earn."</p>

<p>"But I have lots more," insisted Dick. "In
fact, I'd never miss that sum."</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I couldn't take it, though I
thank you very much," and Henry handed back
the little slip.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Dick. "Will you take it as
a loan, Henry?"</p>

<p>"A loan?"</p>

<p>"Yes; to be paid back&mdash;whenever you get good
and ready. Do take it&mdash;as a loan."</p>

<p>"A loan," repeated Henry in a low tone.
"Well, I might do that. But if you're in any
hurry for the money you'd better not let me take
it. I don't know when I can pay it back."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Keep it as long as you like."</p>

<p>"But there's another objection," said Henry,
who appeared to be very conscientious about it.
"You have no security for it."</p>

<p>"I don't need any from you, Henry."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't be right to take it without security.
Wait, I'll tell you what I'll do."</p>

<p>He hurried back into his house, to return in a
few minutes with a folded paper which he
handed to Dick.</p>

<p>"What is this?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"That," said Henry proudly, "is my personal
note for fifty dollars, payable in one month, with
interest at six per cent., as security for this loan.
You can have it discounted at the bank," he added
with a laugh; "that is if you can get your father,
or somebody with some money, to indorse it.
Anyhow, it's my note. The first one I ever gave.
Now you needn't worry about your money, Dick."</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying about it. In fact, I've got a
deal of my own on hand that I expect to make
some profit on. Besides, I'm going to buy a new
motor boat, and I've got to go see about it. Will
you come along?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I'm going to buy that old iron
now," and as Dick started up his auto, Henry hurried
into the house for his hat to go and complete
his business transaction.</p>

<p>Dick rode on for about a mile, when he saw
coming toward him a man in a carriage. The
man held up his hand as he approached, indicating
that he wanted the automobilist to stop.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's the matter?" thought Dick.
"I can't be going so fast that I'm in danger of
scaring his horse. Why, it's Mr. Bruce," as he
recognized the real-estate agent of whom he had
purchased the land he had been looking at with
Guy and Simon one day.</p>

<p>"How are you?" asked Mr. Bruce. "I was just
coming over to see you, Mr. Hamilton;" for he
had been quite respectful to Dick since he learned
of his wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"To see me? What about?"</p>

<p>"About that land deal. In fact, I have bad news
for you."</p>

<p>"Bad news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have just learned that they are going to
put a fertilizer factory up on the property adjoining
that which you bought, and yours will be
valueless to sell for building lots. No one will
want to live next to a fertilizer factory."</p>

<p>"Then it means&mdash;&mdash;" faltered Dick.</p>

<p>"It means that your investment hasn't turned
out well," went on the agent. "In fact, your land
is worth less than half what you paid for it."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50">50</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A TRIP TO NEW YORK</h3>

<p>Dick was keenly disappointed, not so much at
the news of the loss of his money as he was over
the fact that his first investment had proved a
failure. He began to realize that it was not as
easy to make money as he had supposed, even if
you have a large amount to invest.</p>

<p>"It's too bad," continued Mr. Bruce. "Of
course I did not know when I sold you the land
that the factory was liable to go up near it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not your fault," replied Dick. "I
guess the best thing I can do is to sell out and
look for another investment. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"I believe I would do that. I'll sell the land for
you and get the best price I can. When I first
heard about it I tried to get the fertilizer concern
to buy it, but they had all they wanted and stopped
right next to your property. It's too bad."</p>

<p>"Well, it might be worse," said Dick cheerfully.
"It's not going to make me poor, that's
one consolation."</p>

<p>But, as he started up his runabout again, bidding
the agent good-bye, his mind was busy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">51</a></span>
thoughts of what line he ought next to invest in
so that he might fulfil the conditions of his mother's
will.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll let real estate alone after this," he
said. "It's too risky until you know what's going
to be built on the property next to yours."</p>

<p>But the somewhat disappointing thoughts over
his failure were soon dispelled when he saw the
fine motor boat the firm had secured for him from
the factory. It was complete in every detail, from
a small whistle, worked by compressed air, to two
small folding bunks in which passengers could
sleep should the craft remain out on Lake Dunkirk
all night.</p>

<p>Dick arranged to have the boat taken to the
lake and floated, and, a few days later, he had the
pleasure of starting it up for the initial spin. It
ran at fast speed, and beat several more powerful
boats.</p>

<p>Dick did not enjoy this pleasure all alone. He
invited Guy Fletcher, Simon Scardale, Frank
Bender, Fred Murdock and Chandler Norton, the
latter known as "Bricktop," because of his red
hair, to take a trip with him.</p>

<p>"This is great!" exclaimed Frank, as the boat
cut through the water. "Say, Dick, you're all
right, even if you are a millionaire's son and have
money to burn."</p>

<p>"In fact, he's all the better for it," put in Guy,
who had resolved to be very friendly to that fortunate
youth. "Three cheers for Dick Hamilton!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"Drop that!" commanded Dick, who disliked
Guy's manner.</p>

<p>But the boys responded heartily, and if Guy
and Simon joined in with sneers in their hearts,
which did not show on their faces, they alone
were aware of it.</p>

<p>"Here, where are you going, Frank?" asked
Dick, a few minutes later as he saw one of his
guests climbing out on the narrow bow of the
boat.</p>

<p>"Watch me," replied Frank Bender, and, a moment
later, he was standing on his head in his
rather insecure place, his feet waving aloft in the
air.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" cried Dick, as he slowed
down the engine. "Do you want to fall off and
drown?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Frank, as he assumed his normal
position.</p>

<p>"But, you see, I never stood on my head on a
motor boat before and I wanted to do it. I want
to get all sorts of practice, for I'm going to join
a circus some day, and there's no telling what
stunts they may want me to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, you and your circus!" exclaimed "Bricktop."
"You're always talking about it!"</p>

<p>Which was the truth, for Frank took every
chance that came to him to indulge in acrobatics
of one form or another. He was continually
turning cart wheels, standing on his head or his
hands, twisting himself into knots, from which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53">53</a></span>
seemed impossible that he could ever get loose, or
bending himself until he resembled an animated
horse shoe. He was "as limber as an eel," the
boys used to say.</p>

<p>"That's all right," responded the amateur circus
performer, "I'll be in a show some day, with
a suit of green and gold spangles, and you fellows
will be paying money to see me. All except Dick.
I'll give him a free pass."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered Dick with a laugh, as he
started the engine on full speed again.</p>

<p>"Say, wouldn't it be great if we could only
make a trip to New York this way," remarked
Fred Murdock.</p>

<p>"Yes, this boat would look nice traveling over
dry land the best part of the way," said Dick with
a smile. "If this lake only opened into a river or
a canal we might do it, but it's out of the question
now."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go in your automobile?" suggested
Simon, with a curious look at Guy.</p>

<p>"That's so, I never thought of it," replied Dick.
"I believe I will if dad will let me."</p>

<p>"Take us along?" asked Frank. "Maybe I
could get an engagement there in one of the theatres.
I can do quite a lot of turns now."</p>

<p>"My car's too small for this bunch," replied
the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"Hire a touring car; you have lots of money,"
spoke up Guy, with a covert sneer.</p>

<p>"Good idea!" exclaimed Dick, not noticing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">54</a></span>
tone of the remark. "I believe I will. Would
you fellows all go?"</p>

<p>"Would we!" was shouted in a chorus. "Don't
ask us twice," said Fred.</p>

<p>"All right; it's a go!" went on Dick. "I'll see
about it at once."</p>

<p>With Dick, to think was to act shortly afterward,
and that night he asked his father for permission
to take a crowd of his friends to the
metropolis, which could easily be reached in a
day by using a swift touring car.</p>

<p>"Besides," added Dick, as an added reason for
the permission being given, "I may hear of some
investment there."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the land you bought?"
asked Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Oh, that failed," and Dick told the story of
the fertilizer factory.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good lesson to you, my son," was
all Mr. Hamilton said by way of reproof. "No,
I've no objection to you going to New York. Hire
the car you wish, and be sure they supply a good
driver. You're not quite capable of managing
one of those ponderous machines yet. But be
careful. Don't go to buying any gold bricks," and
he laughed.</p>

<p>"No danger," replied Dick. "I've cut my eye
teeth."</p>

<p>It was arranged that they should start in three
days. Dick engaged the largest and finest car in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">55</a></span>
the garage of a neighboring city, and told his
friends to get ready.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" asked Guy of Simon, the day
before that set for the trip.</p>

<p>"Am I? Well, you can make up your mind to
that. I can see something good in this for us."</p>

<p>"Good? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Money, of course."</p>

<p>"Don't get the idea that Dick is going to distribute
five-dollar gold pieces along the route,
Simon."</p>

<p>"I'm not; but I've got a plan of my own. If
this wealthy young greenhorn doesn't drop a few
hundreds in New York, and if I don't get my
share, I'm very much mistaken. You can just as
well have some as not."</p>

<p>"How you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"That's my secret," replied Simon, with a
wink. "I didn't live five years in New York for
nothing. I've got some friends there who will
help me. Just you wait."</p>

<p>"But you want to be careful. Dick is no fool,
even if he is wealthy."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry. I know what I'm about."</p>

<p>The pair, who were well matched, whispered
for some time together, and when they separated,
Simon, with many winks, gave his companion renewed
assurances that Dick's trip to New York
would prove financially beneficial to both of them.</p>

<p>Guy knew little of Simon, who had come to
Hamilton Corners about six months before this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">56</a></span>
story opens. He had met him in the billiard room,
where several youths of the town, who might better
have been at something else, frequently gathered.
Simon never appeared to work, but generally
had plenty of money.</p>

<p>He dressed flashily, and his conversation was
filled with allusions to this or that "sport." Guy,
who aspired to be thought a gilded youth of the
city, rather than a plain country lad, with a father
moderately well off, at once made fast friends
with Simon.</p>

<p>Because of the business relations of Dick's and
Guy's fathers, the two lads had been more or less
friendly for several years, and, when Guy took
up with Simon, Dick did not hesitate to admit
him to his house, where the boys frequently assembled
to play billiards or other games, or practice
in the fine gymnasium Mr. Hamilton had provided
for his son.</p>

<p>Thus, though Dick was aware of the rather
sporty character of Guy and Simon, he was frank
and pleasant with them, for he was a youth of
rather free and easy ways, in spite of his wealth.</p>

<p>Dick would have been glad to take all his boy
friends of Hamilton Corners with him to New
York, but the capacity of the automobile was
limited to seven; so, besides Dick, Simon and
Guy, there went along "Bricktop," Frank Bender
and Walter Mead.</p>

<p>Early on the appointed morning the big touring
car, in charge of a skillful driver, drew up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57">57</a></span>
front of Dick's house, where the boys had assembled.</p>

<p>"Get in!" called Dick, from the window of his
room. "I'll be right down as soon as I can get
my valise shut. I've got to say good-bye to Grit.
Poor fellow, he knows something's in the wind
and he's trying to break his chain to come along.
But I'm afraid something will happen to him in
New York, so he's got to stay home."</p>

<p>"He thinks as much of that dog as if it was a
brother," remarked Guy with something of a
sneer, as the five youths entered the tonneau, for
Dick had elected to ride with the driver.</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," said "Bricktop." "Grit's
a dog worth having."</p>

<p>"I hope Dick brings plenty of money along
with him," whispered Simon to Guy, as they followed
Frank Bender into the machine.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Guy, also in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Because I've got everything all planned for a
neat trick. I guess he'll not bring back as much
as he takes away. I heard from my friend in
New York. He'll meet us at the hotel, and then&mdash;well,
we'll see what will happen."</p>

<p>Dick came running down the steps of the mansion.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he called to his father. "Yes,
I'll be careful&mdash;good-bye!"</p>

<p>There was a tooting of the automobile horn, a
throbbing of the powerful engine, a grinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58">58</a></span>
sound as the gears were thrown into place, and
the boys were off on their trip to New York, Dick
with his heart full of happiness and anticipation,
while Simon and Guy were thinking over the plot
they had made to get away from the millionaire's
son a little of his wealth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A SHARPER FOILED</h3>

<p>Through Hamilton Corners the big car shot,
its progress watched by throngs who had heard of
Dick's trip. His conduct was commented on in
various ways.</p>

<p>"Good land!" exclaimed Hank Darby. "If I
had the money that spendthrift will get rid of before
he gets back here I could make my fortune.
All I need is a little capital and I'd be rich inside
of a week. I have a great scheme on."</p>

<p>"Ain't goin' t' buy any more soap, be ye,
Hank?" asked Porter Heavydale, a little, thin,
wisp of a man, who was fully as lazy as Hank,
but who made no secret of it. "Guess you had
some slip-up there."</p>

<p>"Oh, that&mdash;that was an accident, such as is
liable to happen to any business man," and Hank
carefully whittled a stick until there was nothing
left of it.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, a fool an' his money is soon parted, the
proverb says," commented Porter. "Give Dick
rope enough an' he'll come t' th' end of it sooner
or later."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"Dick's no fool," retorted Hank. "But I do
hate to see him spend money."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he a right to it, father?" asked Henry,
always ready to come to Dick's defense. "It's his,
and I'm sure he has been kind enough to me.
Why, he loaned me fifty dollars the other day."</p>

<p>"He did! Land sakes, where is it now, Henry?
If I knowed that I could have made a deal with
it. Git it for me right away."</p>

<p>"I can't," replied Henry. "I bought some old
iron with it and I'm waiting for a raise in the
market. Besides, it's only a loan."</p>

<p>"He'll never miss it," said Mr. Darby. "Good
land! I wished I a-knowed you had it! I could
'a' bought some oil well stock. It's awful cheap
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' it would be a heap sight cheaper after
you'd bought it," put in Porter with a laugh.</p>

<p>New York was reached by those in the touring
car at nightfall, and Dick registered himself and
his friends at one of the finest hotels, the manager
of which his father knew. The boys had adjoining
rooms in the best part of the big building, and
"Bricktop," Frank and Walter were so excited
over the beautifully fitted-up apartments that they
could do nothing but stare about.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're not so bad," remarked Simon, in
a patronizing tone when appealed to by "Bricktop,"
who demanded to know if this wasn't "the
best ever." Simon had never been in such a fine
hotel, but he wanted to pretend he was used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61">61</a></span>
the luxuries. Guy followed his crony's example
and affected to sneer at the accommodations.</p>

<p>"My father and I generally put up at one of the
better hotels," he said affectedly. "But, of course,
this is all right for roughing it."</p>

<p>"Roughing it!" exclaimed Walter. "Come off!
Why, it's good enough for a king here."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, wait until you've been about a bit,"
answered Simon languidly.</p>

<p>After supper Dick took his friends to a theatre,
where a war-time play was in progress, and even
Simon and Guy enthused over the stirring scenes.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in visiting Central Park,
the big zoo at Bronx Park, and the Museums of
Art and Natural History.</p>

<p>Simon acted as escort, for he was fairly well
acquainted with objects of interest in New York,
and Dick good-naturedly let him pilot the boys
about as though Simon was paying for it all instead
of the millionaire's son footing the bills.</p>

<p>It was not long before a keen reporter had
learned of the presence in New York of the
wealthy youth of whom the papers had recently
contained so much, and there appeared several
items telling of the trip. There were a number of
incorrect stories in print, and Dick was credited
with having expended nearly ten thousand dollars
on his simple little pleasure jaunt.</p>

<p>The result of this was that Dick was visited by
a number of cranks, or, rather, they came to the
hotel; but the wise manager, who had been telephoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">62</a></span>
to by Mr. Hamilton, had an eye to the
wealthy youth's comfort, and few of the bothersome
ones got beyond the lobby.</p>

<p>"I say," spoke Guy to Simon, on the afternoon
of the third day in New York, when Dick was in
the far end of the room, writing a letter home,
"when are you going to pull off that trick,
Simon?"</p>

<p>"This evening," was the cautious answer. "I've
seen Colonel Dendon, and he's coming here to-night.
I'm going to introduce him to Dick. The
colonel says he'll whack up with me whatever he
gets out of him, and I'll see that you get your
share."</p>

<p>"But, say," went on Guy. "This is no gold-brick
swindle, is it? I wouldn't do anything
wrong&mdash;or&mdash;er&mdash;criminal&mdash;you know. Is it all
right?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is!" exclaimed Simon, with a
show of indignation. "Do you think I'd do anything
that wasn't right, or for which I could be&mdash;er&mdash;get
into trouble?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," ventured Guy.</p>

<p>"Of course I wouldn't," continued Simon, with
a great show of indignation that any one should
suspect him. "This thing is perfectly legitimate.
I know a certain party here&mdash;Colonel Dendon by
name&mdash;who has all kinds of stocks and bonds for
sale. Some are better than others. On some he
can make a large profit. They may not be quite
as good as those some other men have, but that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63">63</a></span>
not the fault of Colonel Dendon, or you or me.
It's the fault of the market.</p>

<p>"He's often said to me that if I could introduce
him to somebody with money&mdash;somebody who'd
buy some of his stocks&mdash;he'd give me twenty-five
per cent. of what he made. It's a regular business
deal. It's done every day. Colonel Dendon is a
sort of a promotor. I'm only helping him. It's
perfectly honest&mdash;that is, as honest&mdash;well, it's as
honest as lots of things I know about. I
wouldn't get you into any trouble, Guy."</p>

<p>"I hope not," answered the weak youth, who
believed nearly all that Simon told him. "But if
these stocks are good ones won't Dick make
money on them? And if he does how is the
colonel going to make any?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say for sure that the stocks were
good," replied Simon. "They may be good for
all I know. Maybe Dick will have to hold them
for some time before he can realize on them. I
don't bother with all those details. The colonel
has stocks to sell&mdash;all kinds&mdash;I simply introduce
Dick to him and he does the rest, and pays me and
you for our trouble."</p>

<p>"Then I guess it's all right," assented Guy, a
little doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," declared Simon very positively.</p>

<p>That evening, as Dick and his friends sat in the
private parlor of their suite of rooms, there was a
knock at the door. Simon, being nearest it, answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64">64</a></span>
and, as soon as he had opened the portal,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Colonel Dendon. Come right in. Richard,
let me introduce you to Colonel Dendon, an
old friend of mine," Simon added with a grand
air. "Come right in, Colonel, I'm sure we're glad
to see you," and Simon winked at the man who
entered. The colonel was not at all war-like looking.
He had shifty eyes, and a nervous manner.
His white hair would seem to have indicated that
he was elderly, but his white beard, which was
stained by tobacco juice, did not tend to gain for
him that respect for which silver locks generally
call.</p>

<p>"I'll come in just for a minute&mdash;can't stay long&mdash;very
busy," said the colonel jerkily, as he gave
Dick a rather limp and flabby hand.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have some big deal on that won't
keep," put in Guy, who was playing his part in the
plot.</p>

<p>"That's it. Yes, I've got an appointment with
some bank directors for seven o'clock, and one
with the president of Pennsylvania Railroad at
eight. A big bond sale involved. I heard you
were in town, Simon, and I thought I'd look you
up."</p>

<p>"Glad you did. But, by the way, I don't suppose
you have anything in the line of investment
that you would care to recommend to my friend,
Mr. Hamilton, here? You've heard about him,
I think."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this the young man who has so much
money?" asked the colonel, with a start of seeming
surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that it's such an awful
pile," said Dick with a laugh, for he disliked having
his wealth talked about by strangers.</p>

<p>"I've read lots about you," went on Colonel
Dendon. "No, I'm afraid I haven't anything that
you would care for. I only deal in big sums."</p>

<p>"Well, Dick can command large sums," put in
Guy, with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you would care to take a hundred
thousand dollars worth of mining securities
of a gilt-edge kind?" asked the colonel, looking at
Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I'm hardly up to that yet. I intend to do
some investing sooner or later; but I'm going to
begin small. A hundred thousand is a little too
large for me just yet."</p>

<p>"I was afraid so," replied Colonel Dendon,
with a queer smile. "Well, I must be going. I'm
a very busy man."</p>

<p>He turned as if about to leave the room, and
then he suddenly seemed to remember something.</p>

<p>"Now I think of it, I have a few securities that
I might let your friend have as a favor to you,"
he said, addressing Simon. "They are mining
stocks. I took them from a man who failed, and
I know they are valuable. They are worth to-day
half as much again as I paid for them. But, as
a favor to Mr. Hamilton, I'd let him have them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66">66</a></span>
a small advance over what I paid. I have to do
business on business principles," he added, with
an air meant to be very important.</p>

<p>"Here's your chance, Dick," whispered Guy.
"This man is a big stock operator. You can almost
double your money and make up all you
spent on this trip."</p>

<p>Dick was doing some rapid thinking. The loss
of the money he had invested in the land was
something of a disappointment to him. Then,
too, he felt under the necessity of making some
kind of a paying investment. He had a vision
of Uncle Ezra and the house at Dankville, and
the memory of that gloomy place made him wish
to comply as soon as possible with the terms of
his mother's will.</p>

<p>"I don't mind investing some money, say five
hundred or a thousand dollars, in good mining
stocks&mdash;if you are sure they are good," he said,
turning to Colonel Dendon.</p>

<p>"Good! My dear young man, do you wish to
insult me? As if I would deal in stocks that were
anything but the best. I shall leave at once!" and,
puffing up like an angry toad, the colonel again
turned as if to go.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Simon. "I'm sure my
friend Dick didn't mean anything, Colonel. You
see, he has never bought mining stocks before, and
he doesn't know much about them."</p>

<p>"I know enough to want to be sure they are
good!" replied Dick sharply, for he rather re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">67</a></span>sented
Simon's tone. "I'm not going to be swindled."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the colonel, in less
aggrieved tones. "I was a little too hasty. But I
can assure you, Mr. Hamilton, that these securities
are the very best of their kind. They are gilt-edged."</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew from his pocket a bundle
of certificates which, as far as appearances went,
were "gilt-edged," for there was a broad band of
gilt all around them.</p>

<p>"I can let you have these for eight hundred
dollars," he said; "and they will be worth a thousand
inside of a month. I would keep them myself
only I have bigger schemes on hand. I will
let you have them as a special favor, Mr. Hamilton."</p>

<p>Dick examined the certificates. They certainly
looked just like those he had often seen in his
father's bank. They bore a number of flourishing
signatures and a printed notice to the effect that
they were listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
They called for a number of shares of
stock in a Pennsylvania oil well concern.</p>

<p>Dick felt impelled to take them. It seemed all
right, even if he did have some lingering suspicion
regarding the colonel. Still, appearances might
be against him, and certainly Simon seemed to
know the man.</p>

<p>Dick saw a vision of his investment turning out
well, so he would have no further worry about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">68</a></span>
fulfilling the conditions of the will. Once they
were met he could enjoy his new wealth.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take these," he said, reaching for
his pocket-book, where he carried several hundred
dollars, though he had left some of his money in
the hotel safe. "I will give you part cash and a
check."</p>

<p>"It will be a fine investment," said Colonel Dendon;
but he did not say for whom. "I can assure
you, Mr. Hamilton, that I never sold such gilt-edged
securities before. I am glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant the door of Dick's apartments
opened, and a quietly-dressed man entered. He
looked at the group of boys, noted the bundle of
stock certificates, and then his glance rested on
Colonel Dendon.</p>

<p>"I must ask you to leave this hotel at once," he
said sharply, to the white-haired man. "If you
don't go I shall be under the necessity of putting
you under arrest."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69">69</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>DICK AND THE REPORTER</h3>

<p>For a few moments after the surprising announcement,
no one spoke. The boys and Colonel
Dendon stared at the newcomer. The colonel
was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this unwarranted
intrusion?" he demanded, in pompous tones.
"These young gentlemen and myself were discussing
some financial matters when you interrupt
us. You have doubtless made a mistake, and I
will overlook it this time. Withdraw at once, sir,
or I shall have to call the servants and have you
thrown out of these private apartments, sir!"</p>

<p>"Better go easy," suggested the quiet-looking
man, with just the suggestion of a smile. "If
there's any throwing out to be done I reckon I'll
take a hand in it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir? Leave the room at
once!" exclaimed the colonel, getting red in the
face.</p>

<p>"I mean just this, William Jackson, <i>alias</i> Colonel
Dendon, <i>alias</i> Bond Broker Bill!" said the
man sharply, "that you must leave this hotel at
once or I shall arrest you. You can't conduct any<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">70</a></span>
of your swindling games here&mdash;trying to sell fake
stocks and bonds. I saw you come in, and learned
that you were calling on this young man," and he
nodded to Dick, who was much surprised at the
proceeding. "I got up here in time to warn him,
I see. I hope you haven't given him any money?"
he asked of the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was just going to&mdash;for some bonds he
had."</p>

<p>"Lucky I came in," was the man's reply. "Now
beat it, Bill," and he waved his hand toward the
door. "Take your trash with you," he added,
sweeping the bonds from the table.</p>

<p>Dick and the other boys, with the possible exception
of Simon, expected to see the colonel defend
himself and indignantly reply to the stranger.
Instead he hurriedly gathered up his papers and
fairly raced from the room.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is he a swindler?" asked Dick, faintly.</p>

<p>"One of the slickest in New York," was the
answer. "His game is to sell fake bonds in companies
that never existed, though some of them are
legally organized. Once in a while, just to fool
the police, he deals in regular stocks, but the kind
he usually sells are fake ones. I'm the hotel detective,"
the man went on. "We have to be always
on the lookout for such chaps as he is,
especially when we have young millionaires stopping
at the house," and he smiled at Dick.</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to you," answered Dick
heartily. "You've saved me a considerable sum."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I'm here for," returned the detective
cheerfully. "Don't go buying any gold
bricks, now," and, with a nod at the boys, he was
gone.</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't that rattle your teeth!" exclaimed
"Bricktop." "I've read about those confidence
men and green-goods swindlers, but I
never saw one before."</p>

<p>"Me, either," remarked Frank Bender. "Say,
this will be something to tell the folks back home,"
and, in the excitement of his spirits he tried to
stand on his head in a washbowl on the stand. It
was full of water, and his acrobatic feat was
brought to an abrupt end as he lifted his head,
dripping wet.</p>

<p>"That's a new way to do it!" exclaimed Walter
Mead, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Burrrr! Wow! Whew! Give me a
towel, quick!" yelled Frank. "The water had
soap in it, and it's got in my eyes!"</p>

<p>He groped around with outstretched hands,
seeking a towel, which, after he was able to stop
laughing, Dick handed him.</p>

<p>"Did you know that Colonel Dendon was a
swindler?" asked Walter of Simon, when the
excitement had somewhat subsided.</p>

<p>"Me? No, of course not!" exclaimed Simon
hastily. "All I knew was that he sold bonds, and
I thought it would be a good chance for Dick to
make money. He said he wanted to learn busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72">72</a></span>ness
and make money. I&mdash;I was as much surprised
as any of you," concluded Simon, with an
injured air. "I hope you don't think, Dick, that
I would have had anything to do with that man if
I had known what he was?"</p>

<p>"I'm not blaming you any," replied Dick.
"Mistakes will happen in the best of regulated
financial affairs. Glad that detective happened to
come in when he did or I might have been badly
stung."</p>

<p>It was now too late to go out to any amusement
and the boys, after discussing the recent happenings,
went to bed, planning to visit many points
of interest the next day.</p>

<p>"Well, your scheme didn't work out, did it?"
said Guy to Simon, as they went to their rooms.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," was the answer. "But I give
you my word I didn't know the colonel was such
a swindler as that. Never mind, though, I'll make
money out of Dick&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>Dick and his chums had scarcely finished their
breakfast the next morning, and were preparing
to go out, when the bell boy brought up a card
reading:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table summary="card" style="border: 2px solid" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td align="center">LAWRENCE DEXTER<br /><br />
<i>New York Leader</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked "Bricktop," "another man
to sell bonds?"</p>

<p>Dick handed over the card.</p>

<p>"<i>New York Leader</i>, eh? I wonder what he
leads, a band or some political party?"</p>

<p>"That's a reporter," said Walter. "Going to
let him in, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so. I'm tired of having stuff in
the papers about me; but these reporters have to
get the stories they're sent after, and it's no use
making it any harder for them than they have it.
Tell him to come up," he said to the waiting bell
boy.</p>

<p>A tall, good-looking youth, with a pleasant,
manly air, entered the room.</p>

<p>To those who have read some of my other
books he will not be a stranger, for he was none
other than Larry Dexter, whose various adventures
I have described in "The Great Newspaper
Series," starting with "From Office Boy to Reporter."</p>

<p>"Which one is the millionaire's son, with money
to burn?" Larry asked, with a laugh that showed
in his eyes. He was a little older than Dick.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," answered the wealthy youth.</p>

<p>"I'm from the <i>Leader</i>," said Larry Dexter.
"I've been sent to get your impressions of New
York, and to ask whether you find it a good place
to spend money. Do you mind talking for publication?"</p>

<p>There was such a winning way about this reporter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">74</a></span>
so different from that noticeable in many
of the newspaper men Dick had been inflicted
with, that the millionaire's son liked him at once.
Larry did not take it for granted that Dick must
submit to the questions, but, in a gentlemanly way,
asked for permission to "write him up."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can tell you anything that
will be of interest to the paper," said Dick, "but
I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"That's a relief," returned Larry. "I just came
from a crusty old man&mdash;a professor who has discovered
a new way of making milk keep&mdash;and he
was so grouchy I couldn't get a word out of him.
It's a big change to find somebody who will talk."</p>

<p>"Please don't make up a lot of silly, sensational
stuff?" pleaded Dick. "I'm tired of all that. I'm
no different from other fellows."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are!" interrupted Larry with a
laugh. "You have millions of money, and you'll
find that makes all the difference in the world. It
will gain you friends, position&mdash;in fact, almost
anything. At least so they tell me," he added
with another smile. "I never had a million myself.
But now let's get down to business. What
do you think of New York? Can you spend
money here as fast as you want to?"</p>

<p>"He came pretty near spending it faster than
he wanted to last night," put in "Bricktop."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Larry quickly, feeling
that there was "in the air," so to speak, a story
out of the usual run.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">75</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon Dick told about the attempted bond
swindle.</p>

<p>"Say, this is great!" exclaimed Larry. "This
is the best yet! This beats having you talk about
New York. Do me a favor, will you?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Dick. "If it's to buy
some gilt-edged bonds, I'm afraid I'll have to
decline."</p>

<p>"No, it's only this. Don't say anything about
this bond business to any other reporters."</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to, unless they ask me to," replied
Dick. "But why?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to get a beat out of it."</p>

<p>"A beat?" inquired "Bricktop," while the other
boys looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes. An exclusive story. I don't want the
reporters for any other papers to get hold of it.
If I have it all alone in the <i>Leader</i> it will be a
feather in my cap. News that no other paper has
is the very best kind."?</p>

<p>"Gilt-edged, I suppose," put in Dick.</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Larry quickly. "Now don't
tell any other reporters, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, if they come here and ask about it, I
can't say it wasn't so."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," assented Larry. "But, I
tell you what you can do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Go for a walk, and don't come back to the
hotel until after my paper is out with the story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76">76</a></span>
We publish in the afternoon and go to press about
noon for the first edition. Would it be asking too
much of you to do that?"</p>

<p>"No, for we were going out anyhow."</p>

<p>"Then come with me," suggested Larry. "I'll
take you to the <i>Leader</i> office and have a man show
you how we make a newspaper. I guess no other
reporters will come in there to get the story out
of you," and he laughed in delight at the "beat"
he had secured.</p>

<p>Dick and his friends were only too glad to get
a chance to see a big paper printed, and soon they
were on their way to the <i>Leader</i> office, escorted
by Larry.</p>

<p>"If any other reporters see me they'll think I'm
taking some young men's club on a tour of the
city," the young journalist remarked, as the little
throng walked along. "Well, if they do, it will be
a good way to throw them off the scent."</p>

<p>Larry reported to his city editor about having
most unexpectedly come across a "big" story in
connection with the young millionaire, and was
told to "let it run for all it's worth."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it that the modern Cr&oelig;sus and
his friends are entertained," said Mr. Newton,
another reporter, who was told by Mr. Emberg,
the city editor, to show Dick and his chums
around the newspaper plant.</p>

<p>It was getting close to edition time, and they
noticed, with much amazement, how the reporters
came hurrying in with the news they had gathered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">77</a></span>
how they sat down at typewriters and rattled
it off; how it was corrected and edited; sent
to the composing room in pneumatic tubes; set up
on type-setting machines that seemed almost human;
the type put into "forms" or strong steel
frames; how a soft sheet of wet paper was pressed
on the type and baked by steam until it took every
impression and was the exact counterpart of a
printed page.</p>

<p>The boys watched and saw that these baked
sheets of paper, called "matrices," were sent to the
stereotyping room, where, bent into a half-circle
in a machine, they were filled with hot melted
lead, which, hardening, took every impression of
the cardboard.</p>

<p>Then the curved metal plates, each one representing
a page of the paper, were clamped on a
big press, that worked with a noise like thunder,
and, in an instant, it seemed, white paper from a
big roll, which was fed it at one end, came out
printed, pasted, and folded newspapers at the
other end of the machine.</p>

<p>A grimy boy gathered up an armful of them,
as they kept piling up at the foot of a chute, which
extended somewhere up inside the press. Mr.
Newton, who had escorted Dick and his friends
about, took up one of the journals.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he shouted, above the rumble
and roar of the press, as he handed Dick a paper.</p>

<p>The wealthy youth unfolded it. On the front
page was the story of himself and "Colonel Dendon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78">78</a></span>
It was under a "scare" head, which announced:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>ATTEMPTED SWINDLE OF YOUNG<br />
MILLIONAIRE!</b></p>

<hr style="width: 10%" />

<p class="center" style="font-size: smaller"><b>SHARPER TRIES TO SELL TO DICK HAMILTON, WHO<br />
RECENTLY INHERITED VAST WEALTH,<br />
WORTHLESS BONDS!</b></p>

<hr style="width: 10%" />

<p class="center"><b>DETECTIVE ACTS IN TIME</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Humph!" murmured Dick, when he saw what
a big story Larry had made of it. "If my father
saw this he'd be worried."</p>

<p>"You're getting more famous than ever!" exclaimed
Walter Mead.</p>

<p>"Looks so," admitted the young millionaire.
"Well, I'm glad Larry got his beat, anyhow."</p>

<p>And it was a beat, for, when Dick got back to
the hotel, the manager told him half the newspapers
in New York had been calling him up to
ask about the story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN</h3>

<p>Dick and his friends went home in the big
automobile a few days later, having crowded into
their stay as much sight-seeing as was possible.
Dick had just finished telling his father, the evening
of his arrival, of his various adventures, including
the one with the swindler, when the servant
announced:</p>

<p>"Some one to see you, Master Dick."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Henry Darby."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's a young man who will make his
mark some day!" exclaimed Mr. Hamilton. "If
his father was only like him Henry would have
more chances."</p>

<p>"That's right," admitted Dick. "I wonder what
he wants?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll leave you together," said Dick's
father, as he left the library, and a little later
Henry was ushered in by the servant.</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry!" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"Same to you and more of it," was Henry's
greeting. "I've come to see if you don't want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80">80</a></span>
particularly fine line of gold bricks," he went on
with a laugh, for he had read in the papers of the
attempted bond swindle.</p>

<p>"You'll have to see my secretary," spoke Dick,
joining in the spirit of the talk. "He buys all
my gold bricks. But, to change the subject, how's
the old iron business?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good. In fact, I came to see you about
it, if you're not too busy," and Henry tried to look
as though he had come to discuss the investment
of millions.</p>

<p>"No, I guess I can spare you a few minutes.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"I came to take up my note and pay it off," went
on the young iron merchant, drawing a roll of
much-crumpled bills from his pocket. "Want to
save interest, you know. I managed to sell that
iron I bought, and I made a profit on it. So I'll
pay that fifty-dollar note now."</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly know how to make
money," spoke Dick admiringly. "I'll have to
take lessons from you. But say, Henry, I'm in no
hurry for that money. If you can use it, why,
just keep it."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," went on Henry, with rather a sorrowful
air, Dick thought. "I'd better pay you
while I have it. I might not be able to get it
together again. You take it," and he shoved the
bills over toward Dick with an air of desperation.</p>

<p>"But, I don't need it," persisted Dick. "You
might just as well keep it a while, Henry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean that?" asked Henry earnestly.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Then I will," and Henry appeared much relieved.</p>

<p>"In fact, if you want more I'll lend it to you,"
continued the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth I hated to pay back
that fifty dollars. I mean I still had a use for it.
In fact, if I had a little more I could branch out&mdash;I'm
a sort of a little tree now&mdash;like one of those
saplings they set out. I need branches."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," suggested Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, if I had two hundred dollars more I
could buy out the business of Moses Cohen, who
deals in old metal. He's getting too feeble to
carry it on, and I heard it was for sale. I made
some inquiries and I found I can get it for about
five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"But you said two hundred and fifty was all
you needed."</p>

<p>"So it is. I'm only going to pay half cash, and
give a mortgage for the balance. That's the
safest way. So I was in hopes you wouldn't take
that fifty. I might induce him to take this on account
and wait a while for the two hundred."</p>

<p>"He needn't wait at all," interrupted Dick.
"I'll let you have two hundred more, with pleasure,"
and he drew out his check book with a little
flourish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't give you any security but my note,"
said Henry. "Even that wouldn't be good in law,
as I am not of age. But it shows I mean to pay
you back."</p>

<p>"Of course it does."</p>

<p>"I'll get my father to give you his, also," went
on the young lad of business. "Though I guess
it isn't worth much more than mine," and he
sighed a little, for Henry was aware of his
father's failing.</p>

<p>"Yours is all I want," said Dick. "Tear up
this old note and make out one for two hundred
and fifty dollars. Then you can buy out Cohen's
business."</p>

<p>Henry tore up the fifty-dollar promissory note
Dick handed him and soon had made out another
for the larger amount.</p>

<p>"There's the check," went on Dick, handing it
over.</p>

<p>"I'll get dad to draw up some kind of a paper
giving you a share in the business," continued
Henry. "He heard about me going to buy out
old Cohen, and he wants me to incorporate and
make him one of the officers. I guess that's what
he's best fitted for," and once more Henry smiled
rather sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you good luck," returned Dick as
he shook hands with Henry. "I'm going to put
through some business deals myself soon, as for
certain reasons, I've got to make a good investment,"
and he thought of his failure in the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83">83</a></span>
scheme, while a vision of his Uncle Ezra came to
him like the memory of a bad dream.</p>

<p>It was several days after this that Dick met
Frank Bender on the street. Frank was attired
in his "Sunday clothes" and seemed in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Where you going?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Circus."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Over to Parkertown. They have some good
acrobats in it, and I want to get a few points."</p>

<p>"I wonder why a circus never comes here,"
mused Dick, half to himself. "It's quite a trip to
Parkertown."</p>

<p>"This place is too small," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"They have to have a big crowd to make it pay.
A circus will never come here."</p>

<p>"No, I s'pose not," answered Dick. "Well, I
wish I was going, but I've got to go down to dad's
bank. I've got a little business on hand."</p>

<p>"So long," called Frank. "I must hurry to
catch the train."</p>

<p>"I wish they'd have a circus here some time,"
continued Dick, as he walked along. "Hamilton
Corners is too quiet. It needs stirring up."</p>

<p>Just then he caught sight of a curious procession.
It was composed of a number of boys and
girls, mostly little tots, walking along the street,
two by two, led by three matronly ladies.</p>

<p>"The orphan asylum out for an airing," commented
Dick. "Poor little kids! Poor little
kids!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">84</a></span></p>

<p>There was a county orphan asylum in Hamilton
Corners, and it was usually well filled with small
unfortunates. Twice a week they were taken for
a walk by some of the matrons in charge.</p>

<p>"Poor little kids!" repeated Dick. "I'll bet they
never saw a circus in their lives. And they're not
likely to. A circus will never come here. The
place is too small. No, they'll never see a circus&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came to a sudden stop in his musings. Then
a light broke over his face.</p>

<p>"By Jimminy Crickets! I'll do it!" he exclaimed,
so loudly that several persons in the
street turned to look at him. "I'll do it! That's
what I will!"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I've just got time to catch the train to Parkertown
if I hustle," he added as he set off on a run.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">85</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>DICK INVESTS IN HAPPINESS</h3>

<p>Dick managed to swing aboard the last car as
the train for Parkertown was pulling out of the
station at Hamilton Corners. There was quite a
crowd on it, as many were going to the circus.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Frank Bender, as he
caught sight of Dick walking up the aisle of the
car in which he was. "I thought you weren't
going."</p>

<p>"I wasn't, but I changed my mind. This is a
free country."</p>

<p>"Of course," assented Frank, with a laugh.
"We'll go together and have some fun."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going on business."</p>

<p>"That's too bad."</p>

<p>"Well, it's business connected with fun," explained
Dick. "Maybe I'll have a chance to see
the show with you later."</p>

<p>"See the show! Why, that's the main object
of going to Parkertown," responded Frank. "I
wouldn't miss it for anything. They've got a
fellow in it, according to the pictures, who can
stand on his head, hold a man in each hand, balance
two others on his legs, hold one by a strap<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">86</a></span>
in his mouth&mdash;and all the while he's on a trapeeze
at the top of the tent. It's great!"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe he can give you a few pointers,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>It was about an hour's run to Parkertown, and
when the train reached the circus grounds there
was a general rush to the big tents. It lacked
about an hour to noon, and though the show had
not opened yet there was much of interest to see.
Dick and Frank watched the men putting finishing
touches to the immense canvas shelters, while
others were feeding the animals, getting the big
gilded wagons into place, and arranging the sideshows.</p>

<p>In one tent hundreds of the performers and
helpers were at dinner, while a curious crowd
looked on under the raised flaps. The two boys,
in company with scores of others, watched the
cooks of the circus at work over the portable
ranges and soup kettles, where it seemed as
though enough food for an army was being prepared.</p>

<p>"Say, it's great, isn't it!" exclaimed Frank. "I
can hardly wait until it's time to begin. Let's
go get a hot frankfurter sausage somewhere."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've got to leave you," replied
Dick. "I have some business on hand. I'll see
you later. Maybe in the main tent."</p>

<p>"All right," assented Frank, a little disappointed,
but he soon forgot about that in watching
the many scenes of interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"Where can I find the manager?" asked Dick,
of a man who wore a uniform and seemed to be
some one in authority.</p>

<p>"In the ticket wagon," was the reply. "But
you needn't think you can deadhead in. The
free list is suspended."</p>

<p>"I've no intention of asking for a pass," replied
Dick, with a smile. "Is the manager in?"
he asked, a moment later, of the man who looked
out of the high ticket wagon.</p>

<p>"I guess so. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to see him in regard to the next town
where he is to play."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" inquired a voice from within the
vehicle.</p>

<p>"Some lad from our next town. Maybe the
mayor's sent to say he's going to raise the license
fee. I never see such a hold-up game as these
country mayors try to pull off," and the ticket
seller looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not from the mayor," said Dick. "I
want to see the manager on my own account."</p>

<p>At this another man joined the one at the
ticket window. He was large and fat, and wore
a red necktie, in which sparkled a pin with a
large stone. He had on a tall hat and a frock
coat.</p>

<p>"Come around to the side door," he said, in no
very gracious tones, and Dick noticed that a pair
of steps at the side gave access to the wagon.
He was soon inside the place, which was fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">88</a></span>
up like a small office, with desks, and even a typewriter,
at which a young man was busy pounding
the keys.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the manager, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I've come to see if you won't give a show in
Hamilton Corners," began Dick. "I think the
town would like to see it."</p>

<p>"Maybe the town would, but I wouldn't," replied
the manager quickly. "I'm not in business
for my health. I want to make a little money,
and Hamilton Corners is too small. We couldn't
clear expenses."</p>

<p>"How much do you have to clear to make it
worth your while to show in a town?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, a thousand dollars is fair business."</p>

<p>"If you were sure of a thousand dollars clear,
would you come to Hamilton Corners?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or any place else within traveling distance.
But what are you? A newspaper reporter?
If you are, you want to see our press
agent. He's in that tent over there."</p>

<p>"No, I want to do business with you," rejoined
Dick, with a smile. "I live in Hamilton Corners.
I'd like to see a circus there. In fact, I'm willing
to pay for having one come there. I have a certain
reason for it. If I give you a thousand-dollar
guarantee will you bring the show there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>The manager seemed a little dazed. Dick drew
out a thin red book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll give you the guarantee now," he said.
"Can you come to-morrow?" and he began to use
his fountain pen. "Whom shall I make it out to?"
and he looked at the manager.</p>

<p>"Say," suddenly whispered the manager to the
ticket seller. "Is the marshall out there? He is?
All right. Call him here." Then in soothing
tones he spoke to Dick. "That's all right," he
said. "Never mind the check. We'll come to
Hamilton Corners, anyhow. Now don't get excited.
Here, take a drink of water and you'll feel
better. The sun is very hot to-day. In fact, it
makes my head buzz. Just put that red book
away. Red is very heating, you know."</p>

<p>He paused, and looked rather helplessly about
him. Then in a whisper he again asked the ticket
seller:</p>

<p>"Is the marshall there? Tell him to come in
before he gets violent."</p>

<p>The side door opened, and a town marshall,
with a big nickel-plated star on his coat, entered
the wagon.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dick, somewhat
surprised at the sudden turn of events.</p>

<p>"There! there!" spoke the manager, soothingly.
"It's all right. Don't get excited. You're
with friends."</p>

<p>"Don't you want this check?" asked Dick.
"I'm in earnest. I want your circus to come to
Hamilton Corners."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course, my dear boy. We'll come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">90</a></span>
I'll let you ride on one of the elephants. You can
feed the monkeys, and tickle the hippopotamus,
if you like. Poor boy," in lower tones, "so young,
too."</p>

<p>"Say," demanded Dick, standing up, "do you
think I'm crazy?"</p>

<p>"There! there!" repeated the manager, in that
soothing tone he had suddenly adopted. "Please
don't get excited. It's the worst thing in the
world for you."</p>

<p>Dick glanced up at the man in uniform. Then
a smile came over his face that had assumed a
rather angry look.</p>

<p>"Why, Marshall Hinckly!" he exclaimed.
"How did you come to be here?"</p>

<p>"Dick Hamilton!" exclaimed the officer in surprise,
"I didn't know you at first. You see the
authorities in Parkertown, being a little short-handed,
asked me to help out on circus day, and
so I came over from Hamilton Corners. But
what in the name of green turtles is the trouble
here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the millionaire's son.
"I merely offered to guarantee this manager a
thousand dollars if he would bring his circus to
Hamilton Corners, and he acts as though he
thought I was crazy."</p>

<p>"And isn't he?" burst out the manager, less
frightened, now that an officer of the law was
present. "Isn't he, Mr. Policeman? The idea of
a boy like him offering to make out a check for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">91</a></span>
a thousand dollars to have a circus come to town!
In the first place, I don't believe he has the money;
and in the second, what does he want to hire a
circus for? Say, honest, hasn't he got away from
some asylum?"</p>

<p>"Dick Hamilton broke out of an asylum!" exclaimed
the marshall. "Well, I rather guess not!
As for him not having the money, you're wrong
there. Why, that's Mortimer Hamilton's son,"
and he showed his pride at being acquainted with
Dick.</p>

<p>"Mortimer Hamilton, president of the Hamilton
National Bank?" asked the manager, incredulously.</p>

<p>"That's him," replied the marshall.</p>

<p>"Say!" exclaimed the manager rather faintly,
sitting limply down in a chair. "Give me a glass
of water, will you, please. Mortimer Hamilton,
the multi-millionaire! And I thought his son
didn't have a thousand dollars! Excuse me, Mr.
Hamilton," he said, heartily, as he held out his
hand to Dick. "I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied Dick, with a smile.
"Whom shall I make the check out to?"</p>

<p>"Me," replied the manager. "Wellington Dappleton.
But say," he added, "would you mind
telling me what you want of the circus?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," answered Dick, with something
of a serious air. "When I was out walking this
morning I saw a procession from the orphan
asylum. I heard about the circus being over<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">92</a></span>
here, and I knew those poor youngsters couldn't
go. I made up my mind that if I could, I'd have
the circus come to town and I'd take those kids
free. It's the only chance they'll ever get, maybe,
and I&mdash;well, I've got plenty of money. I can just
as well spend some of it this way as in having a
good time myself. When can you come?"</p>

<p>"We'll be there to-morrow and play the afternoon
and evening," said the manager. "And I'll
tell you what I'll do. You needn't make out that
check now. We'll wait until after the last performance,
and all I'll ask you to do will be to
make good whatever I'm short of a thousand-dollar
profit. Maybe we can get enough admissions
in the town to make up part of the sum.
I'll not see a lad do the only good turn in these
parts. I'll meet you half way, and there's my
hand on it," and once more he gripped Dick's
fingers in a hold that made them tingle.</p>

<p>"But the orphans come in free," insisted Dick.</p>

<p>"The orphans come in free," repeated the manager,
"and any other boys or girls you like. We'll
only charge the grown folks."</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Dick and the manager had
a long talk, so long that Dick had time only to
see the closing acts in the big tent.</p>

<p>"Well, you missed it," said Frank, as he met
Dick on his way out. "You should have seen
that fellow hold all those others. It was great!
I'm going to join a circus."</p>

<p>"Better wait," advised Dick, with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93">93</a></span>
"Have a talk with that acrobat. The show is
coming to Hamilton Corners to-morrow, and you
can ask him how he likes the life."</p>

<p>"The show coming to Hamilton Corners?"</p>

<p>"Yes," and then Dick told of the arrangements.</p>

<p>Hamilton Corners hardly knew itself when it
awoke the next morning. The town was gay with
many colored posters, showing fierce animals
wandering together over vast treeless plains, and
many-hued lithographs of men risking their lives
on the high trapeze. Before the boys had fairly
gotten the idea into their heads that the circus
was coming the cavalcade of wagons began arriving.
Dick had seen the town authorities and secured
the necessary permits. Then Hamilton Corners
really woke up as the news became known
that Dick was responsible for the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Say, he spends money like water," observed
Simon to Guy. "I wish I had some of what he's
throwing away."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'd buy oil stock with it," observed
Guy, with a peculiar smile. Simon did not
answer.</p>

<p>The orphans at the asylum&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;could
hardly believe the joyous news when,
after Dick had told those in charge, it was announced
to them by the matrons. Some of the
poor little tots cried in very happiness. One little
boy, who remembered once seeing some of the gay
lithographs of a circus, was discovered running
around in a circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked a matron.</p>

<p>"Playing I'm a circus horse," was the answer.
"I'se got to do suffin to make de time pass. I'm
so happy!"</p>

<p>Long before the time set for the performance,
crowds of boys and girls were headed for the big
tents. Dick had generously arranged so that no
boy or girl need pay, and hundreds of those in
Hamilton Corners, as well as those in the surrounding
suburbs, besides the orphans, saw the
show free.</p>

<p>Dick wanted to go off with some of his chums
and view the performance, but the head matron
of the asylum asked him to sit with her in the
midst of her little charges.</p>

<p>"They want to see you," she explained. "They
think you own the circus, and that you are the
most wonderful person in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! It isn't anything at all," declared
Dick, with a blush. "I just happened to
think of it when I saw the little children out walking
and saw how sad some of 'em looked. Besides,
it's time we had a circus in Hamilton Corners."</p>

<p>The antics of the clowns, the "hair-raising,
death-defying evolutions in mid-air," as the programme
called them, the performing horses and
elephants, the pony races, the chariot contests, the
trick dogs, pigs, monkeys, and other animals, the
glittering pageant, the music and excitement&mdash;all
this was as a happy dream to the orphans. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">95</a></span>
sat in ecstasy, now and then some of them looking
at Dick, who sat in their midst, as though, like
some good fairy, they feared he might disappear
any minute.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the manager to Dick in the
library of the Hamilton mansion, when the show
was over. "You had your circus all right. I
guess about four hundred dollars will square us.
There were quite a few paid admissions."</p>

<p>"There's your check," answered Dick, passing
over a slip of paper, and the manager took his
departure.</p>

<p>That night, as the rumble of circus wagons
leaving the town came faintly to the ears of Dick
and his father, as they sat in the library, Mr.
Hamilton remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, did you get your money's worth, Dick?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did, dad. The look on the faces
of those orphans was worth twice as much as I
spent."</p>

<p>"Still, you might have invested four hundred
dollars in some business and gotten large returns
from it."</p>

<p>"I invested it in happiness, dad," was Dick's
answer.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Hamilton turned away, loving
his son more than ever. But still he wondered
if Dick would ever be able to fulfil the conditions
of his mother's will.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">"Hank" Darby in Business</span></h3>

<p>Hamilton Corners did not cease talking of
the circus, and Dick's part in it, for several weeks.
Among the boys, Dick was more of a hero than
ever and many were his champions. Only Simon
and Guy sneered, but they took care to do it when
no one else was present. The truth was, Simon
hated to see Dick spend money unless he had a
chance to get some of it, and, since the failure
of the bond scheme, this did not seem very likely
to happen.</p>

<p>For Mr. Hamilton had warned his son not to
get too intimate with Simon. A youth, he said,
who had as a friend a man of the character of
Colonel Dendon was not a safe chum. Dick
promised not to have too much to do with either
Simon or Guy, but he was too independent a boy
to cut them altogether.</p>

<p>"Are you going to be busy this afternoon, dad?"
asked Dick of his father one morning. "Because
if you're not, I'd like to come down to the bank
and talk over a little business with you. I think
it's about time I made some large investment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97">97</a></span>
order to comply with mother's will, and I want to
ask your advice."</p>

<p>"Come along," answered Mr. Hamilton, good-naturedly.
"I will aid you all I can, but I'd rather
you would learn to depend on yourself. Experience
is the best teacher, but her lessons come a
trifle high."</p>

<p>Several days previous to this Dick had been in
correspondence with a New York firm, and he
wanted some advice before he went any further
into a certain scheme. Accordingly, at the time
appointed, he went to his father's bank, carrying
a lot of printed matter and some letters.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Mr. Hamilton, when
he and his son were seated in the private office.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of investing in this company,
formed to supply a new kind of preserved milk,"
said Dick. "Some one has discovered a process
by which milk can be made to keep a long time,
and yet it tastes like fresh. They state that the
milk problem, in big cities, is one that many have
tried to solve. By their method any family can
have fresh milk with little trouble, and it is almost
as cheap as that which comes right from a
cow. Of course, in a big city it's impossible to
supply fresh milk to everyone.</p>

<p>"They are offering to sell some stock cheap,
and it is guaranteed to double in value in six
months. They are all ready to put the milk on
the market. I was thinking of investing some
money in this concern. What do you think of it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton looked over the mass of circulars,
statements of the business that could be done
in New York alone, to say nothing of the rest of
the country, and glanced at the pictures of machines
for making the milk so it would keep for
a long time, without ice, even in the hottest
weather.</p>

<p>"Well, Dick," he said slowly. "This company
has some well-known men connected with it, and
the scheme looks all right. That is as far as you
can tell from this. If you want to invest some of
your money in it I have no objections. How much
did you figure on?"</p>

<p>"I thought about five thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton uttered a low whistle.</p>

<p>"I'd say two thousand," he remarked. "If you
find it's good you can put the other three in later.
Better go slow on a new thing. Of course, I don't
know anything about it, and if it fails I don't want
you to hold me responsible. I'm willing that you
should try it&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Then I'll send for two thousand dollars'
worth of stock," decided Dick; and he made out a
check, had it certified, and sent it to New York.</p>

<p>"Now that's done, and I'm in a fair way to
make a large profit, I think I'll begin to look
around for something else," he said. "It's a good
thing to have several investments; isn't it, dad?
I think I've heard you say not to have all your
eggs in one basket."</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Mr. Hamilton. "Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">99</a></span>
you want to be sure you have good eggs, and not
bad ones; also, that the baskets are strong enough
to carry them."</p>

<p>At that moment there came a knock on the
door of the private office, and when Mr. Hamilton
had called out an invitation to enter, Archibald
Spreckles McIverson, to give him his complete
name, the messenger of the bank, announced:</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Mr. Hamilton. I beg
your pardon for interrupting you, but he says his
business is very important and he will not detain
you long. He also wishes to see Mr. Dick, and
he has a young man with him."</p>

<p>"Show him in," said Mr. Hamilton. "Must be
somebody with money," he added to his son as
the messenger departed, "or McIverson would
never be so puffed up. He loves to announce anyone
whom he believes is wealthy, but I don't
know of anyone, with any great amount of cash,
who is coming to see me to-day."</p>

<p>"Mr. Henry Darby, senior and junior," announced
Archibald Spreckles McIverson with a
grand air, as he held the door of the private office
open so that "Hank" Darby and Henry might
enter. Then McIverson softly closed the portal.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" remarked Hank, almost as pompously
as had the bank messenger. "Fine day, Mr. Hamilton."</p>

<p>Dick looked at Henry's father in amazement.
The man was dressed in a new suit of black, and
wore a silk hat. He had a necktie of vivid purple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">100</a></span>
and a red pink was in his buttonhole. He
took off his tall hat and wiped his shining bald
head with a big red silk handkerchief. No wonder
he had impressed McIverson. Henry looked
a little embarrassed, but Dick nodded at him in a
friendly way, and made room for him on the sofa
upon which he was sitting.</p>

<p>"I have called upon a little matter of business,"
said Mr. Darby, carefully depositing his hat on
the carpet. "I and my son here," and he nodded
in Henry's direction. "I may also add that your
son is interested&mdash;er&mdash;to a considerable extent.
In fact, I may say to an equal extent with ourselves."</p>

<p>"I wonder what's coming?" thought Mr. Hamilton,
who had never seen Hank so well dressed,
and who knew the man to be the laziest fellow
in Hamilton Corners.</p>

<p>"Your son, Mr. Hamilton," went on Hank
Darby, with a grand air that was strangely in
contrast with his former attitude when one met
him about town, "your son, I may state, has been
the means of doing something which I long have
desired to see done. He has enabled me and my
son to start in business&mdash;a business that, while it
is small, is capable of enormous possibilities&mdash;<i>enormous
possibilities</i>," and Mr. Darby looked
as if he would puff up like a balloon and float out
of the window.</p>

<p>"In short," he went on, "he has loaned my son
two hundred and fifty dollars, for which Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101">101</a></span>
has given his note. Of course, that is no legal
security, and when I heard about it I at once set
about putting the matter on a business basis."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Henry is in the old iron business, dad," explained
Dick.</p>

<p>"Exactly," went on Mr. Darby. "The old
metal business, to be more exact. I am also in it
with him. Between us we have formed a company&mdash;a
corporation to be more exact. I have
called it The International and Consolidated Old
Metal Corporation. We have a capital stock of
one million dollars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With two hundred and twenty-five paid in,"
interrupted Henry, with a smile. "Dad took
twenty-five of your two hundred and fifty, Dick,
to get himself some new clothes."</p>

<p>"Exactly," interrupted Mr. Darby. "As president
of the International and Consolidated Old
Metal Corporation I felt that it was due to the
public to look the part. I don't mind old clothes
myself, but the public is apt to judge a man by
them. So I bought these. I think it will go a
great way in impressing the public; do you not
agree with me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered Mr. Hamilton, trying
not to smile.</p>

<p>"So you are president?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"I am," replied Mr. Darby, with a grand air.
"I am the president and you, sir, are the treasurer,"
and he bowed to Dick. "It is with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">102</a></span>
capital that we&mdash;my son and I&mdash;have been able to
make this humble beginning. But all things must
have a beginning. The possibilities are enormous,
sir&mdash;<i>enormous</i>!" and once more Mr. Darby
swelled up. "We are going to begin active operations
at once, sir; in fact, my son has already
begun them. We expect to do a large trade in
metals of all description. I shall devote my time
to the market abroad in a few weeks, as I shall
have exhausted the possibilities on this side of the
Atlantic. Then, sir, we shall be truly what the
name indicated, <i>international</i>!"</p>

<p>"What do you do, Henry?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I drive the wagon, collect the old
iron and sell it again," said the lad, with just the
suspicion of a smile, as he glanced in his father's
direction. "I bought out old Moses Cohen, and
he had a horse and wagon, which I took.</p>

<p>"At least, it's called a horse and wagon in the
mortgage which I had to sign," went on Henry,
"but sometimes I have my doubts about both,"
and he laughed a little. "However, it will do for
a while&mdash;until I can make money enough to get
a better rig."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going a bit slow at first," put in
Mr. Darby. "As soon as I get things in good
shape I shall take a trip to England. I understand
they use a great deal of iron there. Perhaps
I shall buy up a large amount abroad and
ship it here. I have a number of schemes on as
soon as I get this one in such shape that Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">103</a></span>
can run it&mdash;with the assistance of Mr. Dick, of
course," he hastened to add.</p>

<p>"What we came here for to-day," said Henry,
"was to give you these papers, Dick," and he
handed over a large bundle.</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"The prospectus and incorporation papers of
The International and Consolidated Old Metal
Corporation," interrupted Mr. Darby. "I drew
them up myself, and I know they are right. They
show the interest you have in the concern," turning
to Dick, "and your interests are fully looked
after. I wish, also, to endorse the note my son
gave you."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary," declared Dick.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, young man, but it is," insisted Mr.
Darby. "Business is business," he continued,
with a grand air, and, when Dick produced the
note, Mr. Darby, with a flourish, put his name on
the back of it.</p>

<p>"It has doubled in value," he remarked, without
the ghost of a smile. "Now, our matters being
concluded, I will bid you good-afternoon,"
he said, and with a low bow to Mr. Hamilton and
Dick, he backed out, attended by McIverson.</p>

<p>"If he'd let Henry alone the business might
amount to something," commented Mr. Hamilton
when the visitors had gone.</p>

<p>"Yes, the idea of his taking some of the money
to buy a new suit," observed Dick. "Well, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104">104</a></span>
guess Henry can manage it if he only has half a
chance."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give you much for that note," said
Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"You'll not discount it; eh, dad?"</p>

<p>"Not much! It's worse than ever since Hank
put his signature on it. I guess your two hundred
and fifty dollars are gone."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I helped Henry, anyhow. Maybe
he'll pull through. He's a hard worker."</p>

<p>"Gentleman to see you, sir," interrupted McIverson,
putting his head into the office. "Says he
has an appointment with you."</p>

<p>"What is the name?" asked Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Mr. Franklin Vanderhoof," announced the
messenger, with a rolling tone that denoted the
person to be of apparent importance.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'd forgotten. I'll see him at once.
Dick, will you excuse me. I have some business
to discuss with Mr. Vanderhoof."</p>

<p>As Dick bade his father good-bye and left the
office he saw entering it a man, well dressed, and
with a very black moustache. At the sight of the
man's face Dick started.</p>

<p>"Where have I seen him before?" the youth
asked himself. "There is something strange
about that man. I wish I knew what his business
was."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105">105</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>GOLD MINE STOCK</h3>

<p>Dick looked sharply at the stranger as he
passed the man. Mr. Vanderhoof smiled, but
when he did Dick thought the attempted pleasantry
resembled the grin of a cat when it is about
to pounce upon a helpless mouse. With a scarcely
perceptible nod to Dick, Mr. Vanderhoof entered
Mr. Hamilton's private office and closed the door.</p>

<p>"I've seen you before, I'm sure of it," mused
Dick, as he left the bank. "I can't just think
where, but there's something familiar about you.
I don't like your looks, though I suppose you
must be all right or dad wouldn't have much to
do with you. I must ask him about you."</p>

<p>Dick found an opportunity a few evenings
later. He saw his father looking over some
papers in the library at home, and, going in, inquired
if Mr. Hamilton was busy.</p>

<p>"Not very," replied the millionaire. "I'm just
looking over some new stock I bought to-day.
Dick, I'm part owner in a gold mine, in addition
to my many other lines of industry," and he
laughed pleasantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"A gold mine, dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a gold mine in&mdash;let's see where is it now&mdash;oh,
in Yazoo City, Nevada. Of course, I don't
own the whole mine, I've only bought some stock
in it. There it is. I own a thousand shares in
the Hop Toad Mine, and I hope they do as toads
do, and 'jump' in value."</p>

<p>"A gold mine," repeated Dick. "That would
suit me. Why didn't I think of it before."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Dick?"</p>

<p>"I mean, why didn't I invest in something like
that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not too late, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Do you mean I can get some shares, dad?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that you can in the Hop Toad
Mine, as I understand they're all sold out, but I
guess Mr. Vanderhoof has shares in other mines
just as good."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that what Mr. Vanderhoof is&mdash;a mining
man?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly a mining man. He sells
stock in mines. He's what they call a promoter.
Why, do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No, but somehow his face seemed familiar.
I was sure that day I saw him in the bank that I
had met him somewhere else, but when I tried to
think I couldn't recall anyone with such a black
moustache as he has."</p>

<p>"It is black," admitted Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"And when he smiles he looks like&mdash;a cat,"
went on Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't say that I fancy his looks," agreed the
millionaire, with a chuckle. "But I don't do business
on looks. I go by facts."</p>

<p>"Is this mining stock good?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I wrote to some men in Yazoo
City and I made other investigations, so that I
think it as safe an investment as any are in these
days. Of course, nothing is a sure thing in this
world, but I believe this Hop Toad Mine has one
of the richest veins of ore of any mine in that
vicinity."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to invest some of my money
in a gold mine," decided Dick. "Where can I
find Mr. Vanderhoof?"</p>

<p>"He'll be at the bank to-morrow and you can
see him there. Remember, you are doing this on
your own responsibility, and if it turns out a
failure you've got to chalk it up against yourself."</p>

<p>"All right, dad."</p>

<p>"It will be an experience for the boy, anyhow,"
murmured the millionaire, as his son left the
room. "He's got to learn, the same as I did. I
think between his mother's will, his Uncle Ezra,
and what I can show him, we'll make a fine man
of him in spite of his wealth, which is a mighty
handicap&mdash;a mighty handicap," and shaking his
head doubtfully Mr. Hamilton proceeded to look
over some business papers, which task he was at
when Dick went to bed.</p>

<p>Dick received a letter the next morning which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108">108</a></span>
rather disquieted him. It was from the firm of
whom he had purchased his milk stock, and informed
him that owing to certain contingencies
in the market they were obliged to ask for an
assessment on his stock.</p>

<p>"What's an assessment on stock, dad?" he asked
of his father, when he had called at the bank and
shown the letter to Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"It means that the company needs more money
to run the business, and that you, being part of
the company, have to put up your share. Let's
see, they want a hundred dollars from you. Well,
I guess you'll have to pay it."</p>

<p>"But that's a queer way to do business," grumbled
Dick. "I thought I was going to make
money, and, instead, I have to pay out more."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, new concerns frequently have to call
for an assessment, instead of paying dividends,"
consoled his father. "The stock may pay well
yet. Milk is something every family has to have,
you know, and they have to have it every day.
The company may be all right when it gets well
started. I wouldn't worry now. I've had to pay
assessments on many a stock that afterward
turned out well."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I thought of that gold mine stock,"
said Dick. "I guess that will be the best thing yet.
When will Mr. Vanderhoof be here?"</p>

<p>"Almost any minute now. Ah, there he
comes," and, as Mr. Hamilton spoke, the man
with the very black moustache came down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">109</a></span>
corridor that led to the private office and walked
through the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Ah, two captains of industry," he remarked,
with a nod at Dick and his father. "The young
and the&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;I was about to say old&mdash;I will
change it to junior and senior," with a bow to
Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Dick thinks he'd like to buy some gold mine
stock," said the millionaire. "I telephoned you
about it, you recall, and explained my son's position."</p>

<p>"I understand," remarked Mr. Vanderhoof.
"He wants to make a good paying investment."</p>

<p>"That's it," put in Dick, as he thought of his
Uncle Ezra and what would happen if he did not
comply with the terms of his mother's will.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I can find him some good
stock," went on the promoter. "It won't be in
the same mine you're in, Mr. Hamilton. That
stock was too valuable to last long. But I have
some nearly as good. It is in the same neighborhood.
In fact, it is in the next mine to the Hop
Toad&mdash;the Dolphin. We think it very good.
You can make the same inquiries that you did in
regard to the other stock. It will bear the closest
investigation."</p>

<p>"We'll take it, subject to a report from Yazoo
City," said Mr. Hamilton, with a look at Dick,
who nodded an assent, for he knew very little
about buying stock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I suppose you'll pay enough to bind the
bargain?" asked Mr. Vanderhoof.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Dick, producing his
check book. "How much?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars will do as a starter.
But about how much stock would you want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess two thousand dollars' worth will
do," replied Dick, with a look at his father, who,
by a nod of his head, assented.</p>

<p>Mr. Vanderhoof smiled, looking, Dick thought,
more than ever like a cat about to pounce on a
mouse, and when the check was made out the
promoter handed him a document, showing that
he was entitled to a certain number of shares of
stock in a gold mine bearing the name Dolphin.</p>

<p>"Well, Dick," remarked his father, when Mr.
Vanderhoof had left, "you are certainly getting
right into business. How do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Very much. I only hope some of my investments
pan out."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't made very many, but what
you have gone into you have loaded up pretty
well with. However, that may be a good way.
Of course, if they fail, the money loss will not
make much difference to you, but I don't want
to see you lose. It would show a poor head for
business if you did, and I hope you haven't got
that."</p>

<p>"So do I," remarked his son. "Oh, I'm going
to make a success some way or other," and once
more the vision of his uncle's home, the gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">111</a></span>
house set in the midst of the dark fir trees, like
some residence in a cemetery, came to him as the
memory of a bad dream.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" asked his father,
as Dick started to leave the private office.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd take a ride with some of the
boys in my motor boat. I haven't been out for
some time."</p>

<p>"All right, only be careful."</p>

<p>"I will, dad. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Dick stopped, on his way home, and called for
Bricktop, Frank Bender and Walter Mead, inviting
them to go for a ride in his trim little
craft, which was in the boat house on Lake Dunkirk.</p>

<p>"Let's take our lunch and stay the rest of the
day," suggested Bricktop. "It's too fine out
doors to be around the house."</p>

<p>"Good idea," assented Dick. "I'll have our
cook put us up a basket of stuff."</p>

<p>The eyes of the other boys glistened, for they
knew from experience the good things that came
from the Hamilton kitchen, and they had visions
of cold chicken and turkey, fine cakes and big,
thick, juicy pies.</p>

<p>As Dick and his friends entered the side yard,
they saw, standing on the driveway, a rather
dilapidated wagon, drawn by a very bony horse.
In the wagon was something covered with a sheet,
while on the seat sat a grizzled, dried-up sort of
a man, with a little bunch of whiskers on his chin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">112</a></span>
Beside him was a woman in a calico dress, and
she looked worried.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Richard Hamilton?" asked the
man, looking at Bricktop.</p>

<p>"No; he is," was the answer, and Bricktop
pointed at Dick.</p>

<p>"Hum! Well, I'm glad to meet you. I've
been waitin' some time, an' the hired man, the
one with his shirt front all showin', where his
vest is wore out (for thus he described the butler's
dress suit), said he didn't know when you'd
come home. But I brought it along with me, jest
as I said I would, an' I'll show ye how it works.
Mandy, jest hold th' hoss until I git th' machine
out," and though the animal did not seem in need
of any restraint the woman grasped the reins her
husband gave her.</p>

<p>Then, before Dick could remonstrate, the man
got down from the wagon, and began tugging
at the object covered with a sheet. It seemed
quite heavy.</p>

<p>"Would one of you young gentlemen mind
givin' me a hand?" he asked, and Walter and
Frank assisted him in lifting the object down
to the ground.</p>

<p>"There ye be!" exclaimed the man, in an excited
manner, while his eyes glittered in a strange
way. "There she is. Now watch, everybody,
when she gits goin'. Mandy, drive th' hoss up
towards th' stable; it might git frightened.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">113</a></span></p>
<p>"Now," he went on, "ye're about t' witness
one of th' wonders of th' age. Look out, everybody!"
and, with a flourish, he pulled the sheet
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114">114</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>DICK'S BRAVE ACT</h3>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Dick, as he saw revealed a
maze of wheels, levers, belts and cranks. "What
is this? Who are you?"</p>

<p>For an instant he thought the thing might be
an infernal machine.</p>

<p>"Who am I?" asked the man. "Why, I'm
Silas Kendall, of Manlius Centre, an' this is my
perpetual motion machine. Wait until I take th'
chain off so's it can git inter motion an' ye'll
open yer eyes, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Is it dangerous?" asked Bricktop, preparing
to run.</p>

<p>"Not a bit, if ye don't put yer fingers in th'
wheels. It wouldn't harm a baby."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a key, which
he proceeded to insert into a big lock that held
together the ends of a chain which was twisted
about the biggest wheel on the machine.</p>

<p>"Have t' keep it chained up," he said, with a
queer sort of smile, "or it would keep on workin'
all th' while. I'll show ye&mdash;Silas Kendall&mdash;he'll
astonish th' world. Ye got my letter, I reckon,"
turning to Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115">115</a></span></p>

<p>"Letter? No. What letter?"</p>

<p>"Th' one I writ ye about this machine."</p>

<p>"I don't remember&mdash;oh, yes," added Dick,
quickly. He did recall among the many letters
he had received recently (begging epistles most
of them), one in which the writer said he would
soon call to exhibit a new machine he had invented,
and one which was destined to make all
interested in it rich for life. But Dick thought
it was just like lots of other missives he had been
receiving from cranks since the advent of his
wealth, and he threw it away. Now, it seemed,
the letter was from Mr. Kendall.</p>

<p>"Is that really a perpetual motion machine?"
asked Frank, who, with the other boys, was much
interested in such things.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," replied the man. "I invented
it all by myself. I'll tell ye a little about
it before I unchain th' critter an' let it git t' work.
Did ye fasten th' hoss, Mandy?" he asked, as his
wife approached.</p>

<p>"Yep, Silas. Now, do be careful of that contraption.
I ain't got no faith in it," she said,
turning to the boys.</p>

<p>"No, that's jest th' way with wimmin," remarked
Silas. "Yet I really invented it for her."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I was watchin' her churn one day, an'
I thought how awful it was that wimmin had t'
work so hard. So I decided, if I could invent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">116</a></span>
machine that would do th' work it would be a
great labor-savin' device. Wa'al, I went t' work
on it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' he never give up fer a year," interrupted
his wife. "He neglected th' farm until it ain't
worth shucks. He spent all he had saved up t'
buy machinery, an' he ain't hardly slept nights
with worryin' over perpetual motion. I wish
he'd throw it away an' go back t' farmin'. He
made money that way."</p>

<p>"Farmin's too hard work, Mandy," joined in
Mr. Kendall. "We'll be rich now, fer this machine
is destined t' revolutionize th' world. I
come, jest as I writ ye," he went on, turning to
Dick, "t' give ye th' fust chance t' git stock in th'
new company I'm goin' t' form t' make th' machines.
They don't cost much, and we'll be
millionaires in a year. If you've got a leetle t'
invest you'll git big dividends out of this."</p>

<p>"Let's see how it works," suggested Walter.</p>

<p>"All right," assented Silas. "I'm goin' t' unchain
th' perpetual motion machine. She'll begin
t' whizz as soon as I take th' shackles off, an'
then&mdash;wa'al, watch out, that's all."</p>

<p>He sprung open the padlock with a click and
the chain rattled to the ground. As it did so Mr.
Kendall sprang back, as though the machine
might bite him. He stooped down and peered
toward it as if it might spring at him. But nothing
happened. The machine was as motionless
as a hitching post.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"Hum! Suthin's wrong," murmured the inventor.
"Guess it got a leetle stiff comin' over
in th' wagon. I'll jest give it a start. Where's
a pole? Mandy, git me a clothes pole."</p>

<p>His wife went to the back yard, where she
had noticed some, and while she was gone the
boys looked at the apparatus.</p>

<p>It consisted of a big wheel, with spokes made
in zig-zag fashion. The spokes were shaped like
a trough and contained a number of metal balls,
which were prevented from falling out, as the
wheel turned, by some strips of wood.</p>

<p>There were other smaller wheels connected
with the big one, and a tall chute, with a sort of
endless chain, to which were attached hooks and
buckets. There were also several heavy springs.</p>

<p>"Ye see th' way it works," explained Mr. Kendall,
"is by them balls. They roll down the
spokes of th' wheel, toward the tire, so t' speak,
an', of course, their weight makes th' wheel go
'round. Then, when they git t' th' end of th'
spokes they drop out an' roll toward th' high
chute. Soon as th' balls git thar th' endless chain
an' th' hooks an' buckets on it catches hold of th'
balls an' lifts 'em t' th' top. Then they drop inter
th' hollow spokes agin an' th' same process goes
on over agin. It goes on forever, like th' brook
that poetry feller writ about&mdash;I forgit his name.
It's perpetual motion as sure as ye're a foot high.
Ah, here comes Mandy with th' clothes pole.
Now I'll jest give th' big wheel a start, 'count of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">118</a></span>
it gittin' stuck, an' you'll see suthin' worth
watchin'."</p>

<p>With the long clothes pole Silas gave the big
wheel a cautious poke. It began to move slowly,
and he released a big spring.</p>

<p>"Stand back, everybody!" he called. "She vibrates
suthin' terrible when she gits goin', an' I
don't want nobody t' git hurt!"</p>

<p>At first the wheel barely turned. Silas gave it
another prod with the clothes pole and it moved
more quickly. Then it released another spring
and began to gather speed. Faster and faster it
went, the iron balls rolling along the hollow
spokes and dropping out with a noise like distant
thunder.</p>

<p>"There she goes!" cried the old man, his chin
whiskers vibrating in the intensity of his excitement.
"There she goes!"</p>

<p>Faster and faster the wheel whizzed around.
The balls began dropping with such a continuous
noise that one had to shout to be heard.</p>

<p>"How do you stop it?" called Dick.</p>

<p>"No, it won't stop," replied Mr. Kendall, misunderstanding
the question.</p>

<p>"Well, how you going to get it home?" shouted
Bricktop.</p>

<p>"Oh, when I want to stop it I jest throw th'
chain at it, an' it tangles up in th' wheel, an' slows
up enough so I can fasten it. If I didn't it would
go on&mdash;forever&mdash;jest like that there brook."</p>

<p>The machine did seem to be working well, although only on account of the strong springs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119">119</a></span>
The balls, as they rolled down the inclined spokes,
imparted a swift motion to the wheel. The released
balls ran down an incline to the foot of
the chute, and the lifting belt began to slowly
turn over on the wheels on which it worked.
Then something happened.</p>

<p>Whether Silas had not built his machine
strong enough to stand the strain, or whether
the perpetual motion was too much for it, was
never disclosed. At any rate, when the big wheel
was revolving at a rapid rate, and the balls were
dropping out like immense hail stones, there was
a sudden rending, splitting, breaking and cracking
of wood. Then the machine seemed to creak
and groan in agony. Next there was a snapping
sound and the air was filled with a shower of
black iron balls, as though a bombshell had burst.</p>

<p>"Duck, everybody!" yelled Dick. "The thing's
exploded!"</p>

<p>The machine fairly flew apart, splinters of
wood, bits of iron, belts, spokes, chute, inclines
and everything was scattered to the thirty-two
points of the compass.</p>

<p>"Oh, Silas!" exclaimed Mrs. Kendall. "There
it goes!"</p>

<p>"Yep," answered Silas, as he ran to get under
a tree. "Thar she goes, sure enough, Mandy!"</p>

<p>There sounded dull thuds as the balls struck
the earth. Fortunately no one was hit. Then
it began to rain bits of wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess it's all over," said Dick, as he and his
chums looked down from the porch where they
had taken refuge. "What happened, Mr. Kendall?"</p>

<p>"Everything," replied the inventor, in gloomy
tones. "I see what th' matter was. Th' big wheel
was too strong for th' rest of th' machine. Them
balls give it too much power an' it jest naturally
went to flinders. I see my mistake now. I'll build
it all of iron next time. Wa'al, they say experience
teaches us, an' this sure has been a great
experience!"</p>

<p>"It sure has, Silas," remarked his wife.
"You'd better give it up now, an' go back t'
farmin'. That'll pay."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Silas, firmly. "I'm goin' t'
make a perpetual motion machine before I die,
an' don't ye forgit it. I see where I made a mistake
an' I'll profit by it. I don't s'pose ye'll want
t' invest any thin' in it until I make my new
model?" he asked Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," answered the millionaire's
son.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I'll call on ye agin when I git it rebuilt,"
promised Silas, as he piled the bits of his
broken machine into the wagon and drove off.</p>

<p>"Say, Dick, what'll it be next?" asked Walter,
as they watched the disappointed farmer driving
away. "I never knew it was so exciting to be
rich."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's exciting, all right," answered Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121">121</a></span>
and he added: "I don't think that was a real
perpetual motion machine. The springs made it
work. But, come on, or it will be too late for our
motor boat ride."</p>

<p>With a big basket, filled with good things to
eat, which the cook obligingly put up for them,
the four boys were soon at the dock where Dick's
craft was moored.</p>

<p>"Let's go to Handell's Island," proposed Bricktop.
"I heard there was a cave there that no one
ever got to the end of."</p>

<p>"That'll be fun. We'll explore it," said Dick,
always ready for any sort of an adventure.</p>

<p>Heading the boat toward the island, which was
about ten miles away, the boys stretched out on
the cushions to enjoy the trip. It was a beautiful
July day, hot enough to make a ride on the lake
the height of enjoyment.</p>

<p>They reached the island in quick time, for the
boat was a fast one, but, to their disappointment,
the cave did not prove so mysterious as they had
hoped. They managed to get to the end of it,
though the way was choked with dirt and rocks,
and found nothing of interest.</p>

<p>"This cave is a regular lemon," announced
Bricktop.</p>

<p>"What did you hope for? To find some of
Captain Kidd's treasure?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Well, it might have been used by the Indians
once," was the red-haired youth's answer.
"Some day I'm going to bring a lantern and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122">122</a></span>
if I can't find a few arrow heads or the graves
of some dead Indians."</p>

<p>In spite of their disappointment, the boys managed
to have a good time, to which the fine lunch
added not a little. It was getting dusk when they
started for home, with Dick at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>As they approached the dock at Hamilton Corners
they saw, when a mile away, that the lake
in the vicinity of the boat-house was lighted up.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's carnival night," replied Dick. "I
forgot all about it. They're going to have a procession
of boats on the lake. We'll hurry up and
join in. I wish I'd thought to decorate my boat."</p>

<p>He speeded up the craft, anxious, as were the
other boys, to take part in the water pageant.
They bore down on a little fleet of boats, gaily
decorated, and filled with merry, laughing, young
persons. The procession was just forming.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded a sharp report aboard
Dick's boat.</p>

<p>"The motor back-fired," he said. "Take the
wheel, Walter, while I look after it."</p>

<p>But, a moment later, it was seen that it was
no mere back-fire in a cylinder. A sheet of flame
arose from the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p>"The gasolene tank has exploded!" yelled Dick.
"Jump for your lives, boys! The boat's afire!"</p>

<p>Above the hissing, crackling flames the motor
still puffed away, sending the boat straight toward
a confused flotilla of other craft, the occupants<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123">123</a></span>
of which set up screams of terror as they
saw what had happened.</p>

<p>"Jump!" cried Dick again, as he crawled aft
and tried to shut off the engine.</p>

<p>Three splashes in the water told that his companions
had leaped overboard and were comparatively
out of danger.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dick!" cried Bricktop, rising to the
surface. "Jump, or you'll be burned to death."</p>

<p>"I can't!" yelled back Dick, shielding his face
from the awful flames with his arm. "I've got
to shut off the engine, or the boat'll run into some
other one and set it afire!"</p>

<p>Once more he bravely tried to work his way to
the engine. He could not reach the gasolene cock
from where he was. He cast a look ahead, and
saw that his boat was approaching, at swift speed,
a knot of other boats, the steersmen of which
were too confused to know what to do. Some
were getting out of the way, but others were in
the direct course of the burning craft.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" Dick asked himself in a
hoarse whisper. "I must stop the boat, or steer
it out of the way&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>He could neither reach the engine nor the wheel,
for the fire was now raging in bow and stern.
He stood in a little cockpit amidships, where, for
the moment, there were no flames.</p>

<p>Dick looked desperately about him. Nearer
and nearer his craft shot to the boats containing
girls in their light summer dresses. Once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124">124</a></span>
burning motor boat touched the craft in which
the young women were their clothes would envelop
them in flames.</p>

<p>"I must stop my boat!" thought Dick, desperately.</p>

<p>Then a brilliant idea came to him. He gave
one look at the whirring fly-wheel of the motor.
Then, seizing a heavy monkey wrench he opened
the jaws and fastened it on a boat hook, so that
it stood at right angles to it. Then he thrust the
wrench right into the fly-wheel.</p>

<p>There was a grinding, crashing sound, and, a
moment later, the whizzing wheel spokes had
caught the wrench, and, with resistless force, had
driven it through the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p>Dick had scuttled his own boat!</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125">125</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>DICK GIVES A PARTY.</h3>

<p>Lurching to one side, as the water rushed in
through the ragged hole in the bottom, the boat,
with Dick in it, began to lose headway. The
water acted as a brake, and, so large was the opening
the wrench had torn, that, in a few seconds,
all danger was past of the burning boat colliding
with other craft, the steersmen of which were too
bewildered to get out of the course.</p>

<p>Foot by foot the scuttled boat sank. The water
covered the engine now, but the motor still kept
going, for enough gasolene remained in the pipe
running from the exploded tank to keep it in
motion. But the boat was merely floating along,
all speed gone.</p>

<p>"Jump, Dick!" cried Bricktop, who, with the
other boys, was swimming toward shore.
"Jump!"</p>

<p>Dick stood up in the boat he had sacrificed to
save the lives of others. The water was up to his
knees, and, casting a look about him, he prepared
to leap overboard. There was no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126">126</a></span>
need of his remaining, as his brave deed had accomplished
what he intended it should.</p>

<p>But now a new danger was presented. The
blazing gasolene, forced from the bottom of the
boat by the rising water that came through the
jagged hole, was floating on the surface of the
lake. All about the sinking craft was a pool of
flame, ten feet in diameter.</p>

<p>A cry of horror arose from those in the surrounding
boats that had quickly congregated near
the scene. The gathering dusk was lighted up by
the licking tongues of flame, which hissed hungrily,
as though angry at being cheated of their
prey.</p>

<p>"Wait!" called a man in a large motor boat.
"I'll see if I can't get near enough to save you."</p>

<p>He started to steer his craft toward Dick, but
the latter cried out:</p>

<p>"No! Keep away. The gasolene is spreading!
I'll jump!"</p>

<p>He was standing on the gunwale of the boat
now, that part alone being above water. The
motor had stopped, and the boat was floating
amid a small sea of flame. In just the little patch
where Dick stood there was, for the present, at
least, no fire.</p>

<p>Dick crouched for a spring. He saw a place
where the surrounding ring of flame was the
thinnest, and he aimed for that. He was going
to try to jump across the belt of fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly he straightened up. Then, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127">127</a></span>
spring, which lost much of its power because of
the uncertain footing the tilting gunwale gave
him, he launched himself upward and outward.</p>

<p>Arching his hands over his head to cleave the
water, and hoping in his heart that he would clear
the ring of flames, Dick felt himself moving
through the air. Then, with a sudden change in
the little breeze that was blowing, the flames
shifted so that they were wider in extent at the
place for which he aimed. Those in the outer
fringe of motor boats caught their breaths as
they saw what had happened. Dick was headed
for the center of a leaping mass of fire.</p>

<p>An instant later he had struck the water, covered
with the blazing gasolene, and had disappeared
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>"Now to save him, if we can!" cried Captain
Bailey, of the large motor boat <i>Cypress</i>, as he
urged his craft forward. Those in it, as they
approached the outer ring of fire, looked at the
luridly illuminated waters, anxious to catch the
first glimpse of Dick. A dark body came to the
surface. Two hands shot out, and Dick made
an attempt to swim. But he ceased almost as
soon as he made the first strokes, and sank back,
his head going beneath the waves.</p>

<p>Then sounded a splash from the stern of the
boat.</p>

<p>"What was that?" cried Captain Bailey.</p>

<p>"Chandler Norton leaped after him!" was the
answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128">128</a></span></p>

<p>And it was Bricktop who, in swimming to
shore, had been picked up by the <i>Cypress</i>, and
who had leaped after Dick when he saw him sink
back. Bricktop had removed most of his heavy
clothing and shoes, and was more prepared than
any of the others to attempt a rescue.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long time that both he and
Dick were lost to view, but it was only a few
seconds ere Bricktop arose to the surface, one
arm about the unconscious form of the millionaire's
son.</p>

<p>"Help me get him aboard!" Bricktop gasped.
"I'm afraid something has happened to him!"</p>

<p>Willing hands were extended to raise the silent
form. Then, when the brave rescuer had
been pulled over the stern, all speed was made to
shore, which the other two boys had reached some
time since in boats that picked them up.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was, in the gathering of
merrymakers, a physician, who at once hurried
to Dick's side. He carefully examined the youth.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he inhaled some of the flames,"
he said, "or he may have struck his head on
something when he went overboard. We must
get him home, and into bed, as soon as possible."</p>

<p>There were several automobiles at the lake
front, and in one of these Dick was taken to the
Hamilton mansion at a speed which broke the
law&mdash;but no one minded that.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was much startled, but he calmly
gave orders to have his son cared for. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129">129</a></span>other
physician was summoned, and the two
worked over the unconscious form together, while
Mr. Hamilton, his face drawn and white, paced
anxiously up and down in the hall outside the
room.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded the patter of feet on
the stairs, and, a moment later, something was
muzzling Mr. Hamilton's legs, while a gentle
whine begged his attention.</p>

<p>"What is it, Grit, old boy?" he asked, huskily,
as he reached over and patted the big bulldog's
head. "You know something's wrong, don't you?
Well&mdash;maybe it&mdash;maybe it will be all right."</p>

<p>The dog whined and sniffed at the door of the
room where the unconscious form of his master
lay.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;not now, Grit, old boy," said Mr.
Hamilton, softly, and Grit with a look as much
as to say that he knew what was going on,
stretched out&mdash;a grim guardian at the portal of
the silent chamber.</p>

<p>Then, from the room, came a voice, at the
sound of which the dog gave a joyous bark, and
then, as though conscious that he had done
wrong, he changed it to a whine. Mr. Hamilton,
with wildly beating heart, heard his son murmur:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's cold, so cold! Where am I? Is the
fire out? Did I run down any boats?"</p>

<p>Then came the calm voices of the doctors, urging
their patient to be quiet.</p>

<p>But this was more than Grit could do. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130">130</a></span>
whining was like the cry of a child, and he
scratched frantically at the door.</p>

<p>"That's Grit. Let him in," Dick said, in
stronger tones, and Mr. Hamilton uttered a silent
prayer of thanksgiving. The portal was swung
and Grit bounded into the room, followed by the
millionaire. One of Dick's hands hung over the
side of the bed, and Grit began licking it frantically.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;old Grit," murmured Dick, and Grit
was content.</p>

<p>"How is he?" asked Mr. Hamilton, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, dad," answered Dick, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Not as bad as we feared," answered one of
the physicians. "He has inhaled no flames, but
he struck his head on something as he jumped.
Probably on a bit of floating wreckage. He will
be all right after a few days' rest. But he must
be kept quiet. No excitement. I congratulate
you on your brave son, Mr. Hamilton."</p>

<p>The millionaire silently wrung the hand the
physician held out to him.</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything," murmured Dick, in
sleepy tones. "I had to stop the boat, and the
only way I saw was to put a hole in the bottom.
Too bad; it was a fine boat."</p>

<p>"You can have another, if we can't raise her,"
interrupted Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Then I knew I'd have to swim under water<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131">131</a></span>
to avoid the flames," went on Dick. "I held my
breath as long as I could, and then I hit something.
I can't remember any more."</p>

<p>He sank into a doze, with Grit still licking the
drooping hand.</p>

<p>"I think he will sleep now," said the physician
who had examined Dick at the lake. "We will
go out, and the dog had better come, too."</p>

<p>"Come, Grit," called Mr. Hamilton, but Grit
paid no attention.</p>

<p>"I'll bring him," said the physician, as he
reached for the bulldog's collar. Grit growled
menacingly.</p>

<p>"Better not," advised the millionaire. "No one
but Dick can do anything with him."</p>

<p>So they had to leave Grit there, but he was
not in the least in the way, being content to rest
beneath the bed, though whenever anyone&mdash;nurse
or doctor&mdash;approached, the dog was ever on the
watch.</p>

<p>Dick had to stay in bed three days, and for
three days more was a sort of semi-invalid in an
easy-chair. Then, the physicians having pronounced
all danger past, he was allowed to go
out. In the meantime the motor boat was raised
and taken away to be repaired.</p>

<p>"Say, I never knew what nice sunshine and
fine air we had in this town," said the youth
to his father, as he walked down the street with
him. "It's worth while being under the weather
a bit just to appreciate it when you get out."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132">132</a></span></p>

<p>"I never knew you had so many friends, Dick,"
answered his father.</p>

<p>"Friends? How?"</p>

<p>"Why, we had to keep one of the maids busy
answering the bell while you were in bed. I
guess every boy, and lots of the girls, in Hamilton
Corners called to see how you were getting
on."</p>

<p>"I'm glad they thought of me," replied the
millionaire's son. "I wish I could show I appreciate
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you can, Dick."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest that you hold a little
reception&mdash;give a sort of party. That's what we
called 'em when I was a boy."</p>

<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Dick. "That
will be sport. But&mdash;where could I have it?"</p>

<p>"In the house, of course. Isn't it large
enough?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. It's too big and fine. I'm
afraid some of the boys wouldn't have a good
time, for fear of dropping some cake or ice-cream
on the carpets."</p>

<p>"Well, what would you suggest? You might
give it in the barn."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of hiring a big tent and having
a party out doors on the lawn. That would
be unconventional and rather jolly, I think."</p>

<p>"Good idea," answered the millionaire. "I'll
order a tent at once and see to the refreshments."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me do that," begged Dick. "I know
what boys and girls like to eat."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented his father, with a laugh.
"You can do just as you please, and&mdash;er&mdash;send
the bills to me."</p>

<p>"Not much!" exclaimed Dick, proudly. "I'm
paying my own way now."</p>

<p>A week later a big white tent was erected on
the spacious lawn at the Hamilton mansion.
Dick had spent a busy seven days in making the
arrangements, and every boy and girl in Hamilton
Corners, whom Dick had the least acquaintance
with, was invited.</p>

<p>Seldom had there been so much excitement in
the town, not even when the circus came, for on
this occasion the girls, at least, could "dress up,"
and we all know what that means to a girl. Nor
were the boys behindhand in looking over their
best suits and putting an extra shine on their
shoes.</p>

<p>The big tent was gay with Chinese lanterns,
and a corps of white-suited waiters were in attendance
to dispense the good things when, as
darkness began to gather, the young people of
the town began to assemble at the party. They
came from all directions, some of them awkward
and shy, for it was their first big affair, while
others were more self-possessed.</p>

<p>"Well, are you ready?" asked Simon Scardale,
as he called at Guy Fletcher's house, for both had
been invited to the gathering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't care much about going.
We'll have a slow time."</p>

<p>"Maybe we will, but I've got a little thing I
want to plan out, and I can do it there, I think.
The fact is, I need money badly, and I've got to
get some."</p>

<p>"I hope you're not going to rob the house,"
remarked Guy, with a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course not, but I've got a scheme that may
work. Come along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135">135</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE CONSPIRACY</h3>

<p>Dick stood at the entrance to the tent receiving
his guests. He was a little pale from his recent
experience, but otherwise did not seem to
have suffered any ill effects.</p>

<p>"Well, Bricktop," he called heartily, as the
sandy-haired youth approached, his face almost
the color of his locks, "I was afraid you wouldn't
come. If it hadn't been for Bricktop there
wouldn't have been any party here to-night," he
went on, turning to a group of young people.
"No, nor any Dick Hamilton, either. He pulled
me out in the nick of time."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! I didn't do anything," protested
Bricktop, who hated praise.</p>

<p>"I think he was perfectly splendid!" exclaimed
Mabel Ford, looking at Bricktop with her big
blue eyes in a way that made that modest hero
blush more fiercely than before.</p>

<p>"It was perfectly grand!" declared Bertha Lee,
known as "Birdy" among her friends. "How I
wish I was a big, strong young man," and she
gazed admiringly at Bricktop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not a strong lady," suggested Simon
Scardale, with a grin, as he joined the group.</p>

<p>At his approach several girls moved away, as
they did not like him. Guy was close in Simon's
wake, and both boys nodded to Dick.</p>

<p>"Feeling pretty fit now, old chap?" asked
Simon.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"Feel like having a game of billiards?" went
on Simon. "I'll bet you ten dollars I can beat
you on your own table."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," replied Dick, with a laugh.
"I'm too busy looking after my guests to-night.
Besides, I don't play for money. Come over
some other time and I'll play you all you like, for
fun."</p>

<p>"Stingy beast," muttered Simon, as Dick
moved away to greet some newcomers, "and I
need the money, too."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd lose," suggested Guy.</p>

<p>"I don't play to lose," replied Simon, with an
ugly leer.</p>

<p>The little feeling of strangeness which many
of the boys and girls at first experienced gradually
wore off, and soon the party was in full
swing. All sorts of games were played, and Dick
and his closest chums saw to it that there was no
lack of liveliness. A number of the fathers and
mothers of the younger children had accompanied
them, and to these older folks Dick was attentive,
seeing that they had seats, and sending the wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137">137</a></span>ers
to them to ask if they wouldn't have a cup of
coffee or some ices before supper was served.</p>

<p>"Say," observed one man to his wife, after
Dick had found them chairs, "you'd never know
he was a millionaire, would you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why, because he's just like other boys&mdash;he's
like one of our own folks."</p>

<p>"Of course he is," answered his wife. "It's
only the wrong kind of people that money makes
any difference to. Dick Hamilton can't help being
nice. His money hasn't spoiled him," which
view was shared by more than one that night.</p>

<p>And such a supper as there was! Long years
afterward some of the boys and girls, who were
quite small when they attended Dick's party, used
to tell of it as though it was a visit to fairyland.
Dick fairly outdone himself in seeing that everyone
had a good time, and from the faces around
the long tables, set within the tent, it was evident
that the way to young people's hearts, or, at least,
to their good spirits, is through their stomachs.</p>

<p>Dick walked about, like a perfect host, seeing
that everyone was served, before sitting down
himself. At his heels followed Grit, who was
unhappy when away from his master.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a perfect darling of a dog!" exclaimed
Birdy Lee, as she stopped over to pat
Grit, which indignity he suffered in disdainful
silence.</p>

<p>"Isn't he sweet!" chorused several other girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he's no beauty, judged by young ladies'
standards," said Dick, with a gallant look at his
girl friends. "But beauty in a bulldog is more
than skin deep," he added. "Grit is pure gold
when it comes to being a friend."</p>

<p>"What makes his two teeth stick up that way?
Don't they hurt his lip?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I never heard him complain," replied Dick.
"But I'd better move along, I guess. Grit is getting
hungry, and I don't want him to begin on
any of the waiters. He doesn't take to colored
men very well. One of them started to run when
Grit growled at him a while ago as the man was
bringing in a roast chicken."</p>

<p>After supper there were more games, and the
fun increased as the hours passed. Dick was congratulated
on every side, not only for the success
of his party, but on his speedy recovery from
the boat accident.</p>

<p>As the millionaire's son was crossing the tent,
with Grit following at his heels, he met Guy and
Simon, who had been together all the evening,
and who had not mingled much with the other
guests.</p>

<p>"Hello, Grit, old boy!" exclaimed Simon, but
the dog must have detected the insincerity in the
youth's tones, for he uttered a low growl and
showed his strong teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to hurt you," sneered
Simon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't think it would be exactly healthy,"
remarked Dick.</p>

<p>"Is he a very valuable dog?" Simon went on,
paying no further attention to Grit.</p>

<p>"Well, he's rated at a thousand dollars in the
records of the Kennel Club," answered Dick. "I
don't know that any dog is worth so much from
a financial standpoint, but I know I wouldn't sell
him for that; would I, Grit?" and the bulldog
almost wagged his stump of a tail off in delight
at Dick's caressing words.</p>

<p>"Humph! I'd look at a thousand dollars a
good while before I'd give it for a dog," cried
Simon.</p>

<p>"You don't know Grit," was Dick's quiet answer,
as he turned away.</p>

<p>"Come on, Guy," said Simon, a little later.
"I'm going to clear out of here."</p>

<p>"What for? Let's have some more ice-cream.
It's bully."</p>

<p>"No," replied Simon, shortly. "I've got a
scheme on for making some money out of Dick,
and taking him down a peg. I owe him something
for spoiling that bond sale."</p>

<p>"But he didn't spoil it," replied Guy, who, in
spite of certain mean traits of character, was inclined
to be fair. "Besides, you wouldn't have
sold Dick worthless bonds, would you?"</p>

<p>"How was I to know they were worthless?"
asked Simon, with a short laugh. "He has to
take chances in this world. But this time there'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140">140</a></span>
be no slip-up. Come on, I've got to see a man
to-night."</p>

<p>As the two walked from the tent, where the
merry-making was still going on, Guy saw something
dangling from Simon's pocket. It looked
like a small black snake.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, in some alarm.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Simon. "That's the leash
thong of Dick Hamilton's bulldog. Come along!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>DICK TURNS DETECTIVE</h3>

<p>"Well, Dick," remarked Mr. Hamilton at
breakfast the next morning, "your party was a
great success."</p>

<p>"I hope they all had a good time. They seemed
to. I know I did."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were a fine lot of young people,"
went on the millionaire. "Oh, by the way, I had
a letter from the man in Yazoo City I wrote to
about your gold mine stock. Nick Smith, his
name is. He's an old forty-niner, I understand."</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"The mine is all right. He sent me a report
from the government assay office, and I guess
the Dolphin is as good as the Hop Toad."</p>

<p>"Then I'd better finish paying for the stock
when Mr. Vanderhoof comes to town again,"
said Dick. "It will be mine then, and all I'll
have to do is to wait for it to increase and pay
me big dividends."</p>

<p>"I hope it does," answered Mr. Hamilton. "I
also had a letter from Vanderhoof yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142">142</a></span>
He also had heard from Smith, it appears, and
as he learned the mine was favorably reported
on, he sent word that he'd call to-day for the
fifteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"He can have it, dad," said Dick. "I guess
I'll go down to the bank with you. What time
will Mr. Vanderhoof be there?"</p>

<p>"At eleven, his letter said. Well, if you have
finished breakfast, come along. You're getting
to be quite a financier."</p>

<p>"I'm going to make that a paying investment if
it's a possible thing," answered Dick, as he
walked through the well-kept grounds toward
the street and thought of Uncle Ezra's place.</p>

<p>Mr. Vanderhoof was promptly on time, and
had the bonds ready for Dick, who paid for
them with a check. The youth, who had about
given up trying to recall where he had seen Vanderhoof
before, thought the mining promoter
smiled more than ever like a cat as he handed
over the securities and took the money.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope you double your capital," he
remarked, with a smirk that showed nearly all
his teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I make twenty-five per cent. I'll be
satisfied," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be in town for a few days," Mr.
Vanderhoof went on, "and if either of you would
like to take some more mining stock I'll be glad
to accommodate you."</p>

<p>"I have enough," replied the millionaire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143">143</a></span>
Dick answered that he wanted to see how this
investment turned out before venturing another.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be in town, at any rate," was the
promoter's parting remark.</p>

<p>Dick felt quite like a man of business as he
looked over his check book a little later and
noted what he had paid out. True, he had taken
in nothing since he had come into his fortune,
but he knew the wealth his mother had left him
was accumulating interest all the while&mdash;faster,
in fact, than he had spent it so far. Still he
wished that he was receiving an income from
some efforts of his own.</p>

<p>"Never mind, wait until my stock in the gold
mine and the milk company begins to boom," he
told himself. "That is, if that milk concern
doesn't demand another assessment," he added,
dubiously.</p>

<p>Dick walked slowly home, and, passing around
the side of the house, approached the stable. He
intended taking a gallop on Rex that afternoon
and wanted the groom to have the horse in readiness.
As he neared Grit's kennel he noticed that
the chain was thrown over the top of the house,
as it usually was when the dog was loose.</p>

<p>"Where's Grit?" he asked of Peters, the groom.</p>

<p>"Grit, Master Dick?" inquired the man, in
great surprise. "Sure an' didn't you send for him
about an hour ago?"</p>

<p>"Me send for him?" repeated Dick in some
alarm, for Grit, even if he was unchained, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144">144</a></span>
not stray away from the stable. He was nowhere
in sight, and Dick at once became worried.</p>

<p>"Sure, Master Dick," went on the groom.
"About an hour ago a youngish chap came here
and said you'd sent him for Grit."</p>

<p>"And you let him take him?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure, I thought you'd sent for him, as
you did once."</p>

<p>"Yes, but then I sent a note, Peters."</p>

<p>"That's so, but the young man had Grit's leash,
sir; and, though the dog was inclined to be a bit
ugly, he seemed to know the leash and went
along after a bit."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man got him?" asked Dick,
quietly, though he was much excited over what
seemed to be the theft of his pet.</p>

<p>"A young man, not very nice-looking, Master
Dick, and smelling very strong of the stables. In
fact, that's what made Grit finally take to him.
Grit's very fond of horses and stables, sir. He'll
let almost anyone come near him as long as
they've been around a barn."</p>

<p>"That's so. Did the man say anything, or give
any name?"</p>

<p>"No. He just said you were going for a walk
and wanted Grit to go 'long. Said you was too
busy to come and had sent the leash so's he'd have
no trouble. He didn't have&mdash;that is, not very
much&mdash;barring that Grit wanted to get hold of
his leg first. But when the dog had sniffed at
the leash, probably knowin' it came from you, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145">145</a></span>
was quiet enough. But I could see the man was
askeered of him, Master Dick. He walked to
one side like. Why, Master Dick, is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? I should say so! Grit's been stolen,
Peters."</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Master Dick!" exclaimed
the man, much alarmed at his part in the matter.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's been stolen, and by a clever trick,"
went on Dick. "But I don't blame you, Peters.
I remember now, I lost the leash thong last night.
I had it on Grit and I took it off and put it in my
pocket. Then I missed it after the party, and I
was too tired to look for it. Someone must
have found it, and, knowing it belonged to Grit,
made up his mind to steal him. The fellow must
have known he'd come more willingly after
smelling his own leash."</p>

<p>"But you must have lost it somewhere around
here," went on Peters. "Someone at the party
may have found it."</p>

<p>"If they had they would have known it was
mine," answered Dick. "No, I think someone
outside found it and he stole Grit. Well, I've
got to find him, that's all. Saddle Rex, and I'll
make some inquiries about town."</p>

<p>"But it's near dinner-time, Master Dick."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I can't eat if Grit is gone," and
with a heavy heart Dick waited for the horse to
be saddled. He whistled shrilly his favorite call
to Grit, hoping the dog might have broken away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146">146</a></span>
not far from the stable, and be in hiding somewhere,
but no Grit appeared.</p>

<p>On the back of Rex, Dick made a hasty tour
of the immediate neighborhood, inquiring of
various persons he met if they had seen the bulldog.
Grit was well known about Hamilton Corners,
for he was often seen in his master's company.
But this time no one had noticed him being
led off in leash by a young man who seemed
quite afraid of the brute that was so handsome
for his very ugliness.</p>

<p>"He's been stolen for a reward," was Mr.
Hamilton's opinion when he came home to lunch
and heard Dick's woeful story. "You'll hear
from him sooner or later. Better advertise in
the county papers."</p>

<p>Dick put in several notices that afternoon, offering
to pay a reward of a hundred dollars for
the return of Grit.</p>

<p>"Now we'll have to wait," said the millionaire.
"Never mind, Dick; if Grit is gone you can get
another dog," for Mr. Hamilton was as fond of
animals as was his son.</p>

<p>"There'll never be another Grit," answered
Dick, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Grit was being led across the country
fields which stretched out back of the Hamilton
mansion.</p>

<p>"I've got to keep off the roads," muttered the
youth who had hold of the leash. "There's too
many people as knows a dorg like this. I wish I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147">147</a></span>
hadn't gone into this game. It's too risky, not
only at bein' caught, but I don't like the way this
dorg looks at my legs. He looks hungry."</p>

<p>Indeed, Grit was in no amiable frame of mind.
He consented to be led along because he recognized
his old leash, and the man leading him
had the familiar smell of horses, which Grit loved
so well. The dog was a little suspicious, but
once before Dick had sent a stranger for him
and the man had smelled of horses, so Grit,
though he had grave doubts, was willing to go
along. But he was getting anxious to see his
master, as his uneasy growls from time to time
indicated, to the no small alarm of the somewhat
ragged youth leading him.</p>

<p>"Easy now, old boy," he said. "That's a good
dorg. We'll soon be there," he added, as he cast
an uneasy look around. "The wagon must be
waiting somewheres about here."</p>

<p>He cut through a little clump of trees and
emerged upon an unfrequented road that led to
Leonardville, a distant settlement.</p>

<p>"There's the rig!" he exclaimed, as he caught
sight of a wagon and a horse hitched to the
fence. "The worst of it's over."</p>

<p>"Did you get 'im?" asked a man in the wagon.</p>

<p>"Yep, an' I'll be glad to git rid of 'im. He's a
little too anxious to see what my legs is made of."</p>

<p>Grit was led toward the wagon. He seemed to
think something was not just right, for he
growled menacingly and hung back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold 'im a minute now, until I git the bag,"
ordered the man in the wagon, and, as the ragged
youth did so, the man suddenly threw a big sack
over Grit's head. Then, hastily wrapping him
up in it and tying several turns of rope about it,
the sack and dog were tossed into the wagon.</p>

<p>"Quick's the word!" exclaimed the man, as he
and the youth got up on the seat and drove off.
"Now to get our share of the reward. I hope
that young feller what put up this job knows
what he's about."</p>

<p>Poor Grit, whining and growling alternately
in the bottom of the wagon, tried to work the
suffocating bag off his head, but it was too tightly
fastened.</p>

<p>The mail the next day brought Dick a badly-written
and worse-spelled missive, in which it
was stated that if he wanted Grit returned he
could have him by paying two hundred dollars'
reward. No names were signed, and the handwriting
was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said Mr. Hamilton. "But
who's got him?"</p>

<p>"The letter doesn't say. I'm to leave two hundred
dollars to-night under a flat stone, near the
stump just where the county road crosses Butternut
Creek. Then, the letter says, the dog will be
back at the stables to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Hamilton, "that's a
hundred more than you advertised to pay. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149">149</a></span>
guess you can't help yourself. You'd better do
as the letter says."</p>

<p>"I'll not!" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? Inform the police?
They won't be able to do much. Besides,
they'll never bother over a dog, no matter how
valuable he is."</p>

<p>"No," replied Dick. "I'm not going to tell the
police."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to turn detective myself and find
Grit! See, here is the first clue," and he held up
the envelope of the letter. "This was mailed in
Leonardville. I'm going there for a starter, and
I'll find Grit!"</p>

<p>With flashing eyes Dick hurried to the stables
to order Rex saddled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>GRIT'S REVENGE.</h3>

<p>Peters soon had the horse ready, and as Dick
leaped into the saddle his father came hurrying
out to the stables.</p>

<p>"Now be careful, Dick," he cautioned. "Don't
do anything rash. What are your plans?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to ride in the direction of Leonardville.
That's about ten miles by the main road.
I'll inquire as I go along; but what I'll do after
I get there I can't tell."</p>

<p>"Well, be careful, that's all," concluded Mr.
Hamilton. "The fellows who stole Grit are no
common thieves, I imagine, and I hope you don't
get into trouble with them."</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying about trouble. Once I get
where Grit is, he and I can take care of the
thieves all right," and Dick laughed grimly.</p>

<p>He started off at an easy canter, though Rex
was full of mettle and wanted to gallop.</p>

<p>"No, Rex," said Dick, for he had a habit of
talking to his horse as he did to Grit. "We'll
take it easy. We've got a long day ahead of us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151">151</a></span></p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock, and Dick decided to
ride several miles without stopping to make inquiries,
as the day previous he had pretty well
covered the neighborhood near his home. But in
about an hour, having reached a small village,
he asked several persons he met if they had seen
anything of his dog. No one had, and he pushed
on.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he rode, stopping every little
while to make inquiries, but without avail. He
got dinner at a wayside hotel and then resumed
his trip. It was about three o'clock when, as he
stopped at a watering trough under a big chestnut
tree on the edge of the road, he saw a wagon
coming toward him.</p>

<p>"I'll ask this man," thought Dick. He waited
until the vehicle and the driver were in plainer
view through the cloud of dust raised and then
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Henry! How'd you get out here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been after some old iron," replied
the secretary and general man-of-all-work of the
International and Consolidated Old Metal Corporation.
"I heard of a farmer who had a lot
of scrap for sale and I went after it."</p>

<p>"Did you get it?"</p>

<p>"Sure. It's in the wagon," and Henry nodded
toward the rear of his vehicle, which was filled
with a mass of broken iron. "I started away
from home yesterday afternoon expecting to get
back last night, but I had a breakdown and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152">152</a></span>
to stay until morning. But what are you doing
out here?"</p>

<p>"Looking for Grit," and then Dick told about
the theft of his dog. "I don't s'pose you've seen
anything of him, have you?"</p>

<p>"Where did you say that letter came from?"
asked Henry, showing some excitement.</p>

<p>"Leonardville. That's where I'm headed for.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Then I saw your dog!" exclaimed Henry.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Dick, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I was driving along last night," went on the
young representative of the old metal concern,
"and, just before I had my breakdown, I saw a
wagon pass me. I looked in the back and saw
something covered with a blanket. It was moving,
and I wondered what it could be when I
heard a dog bark. I thought it was rather funny
to cover a dog up that way on a hot day. One
of the men leaned back, and, when it barked, he
hit the dog with a whip."</p>

<p>"Poor Grit!" murmured Dick. "Wait till I
get hold of those fellows. Where did they go,
Henry?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. I was thinking that was a pretty
mean way to treat a dog, but I never thought they
might have stolen him, and were trying to keep
him hid. I watched their wagon until it was out
of sight and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you lose sight of them?" broke in Dick.</p>

<p>"I went on a little farther," continued Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153">153</a></span>
"and one of the springs of my wagon broke. I
knew I couldn't get it fixed until morning, so I
unhitched the horse and drove him along until I
came to a hotel. This was at Maysville, and
when I got to the tavern I saw the same two fellows.
They were just driving away, and I heard
one say it wasn't far to the Eagle Hotel. Now
there's an Eagle hotel in Leonardville, and I'll bet
you'll find your men and dog there. I'd like to go
back with you and help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Henry," interrupted Dick.
"I guess I can manage," and, calling back his
thanks to the young iron merchant, and promising
to see him later, Dick urged his horse off at
a gallop, disappearing in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"Now there's a good example for you to follow,
old bag of bones," said Henry, addressing
his own steed. "Why don't you try that for a
change and you'd get home to supper quicker.
Well, I s'pose you'll last longer if you don't go
so fast," and, with that comforting reflection,
Henry managed, after a time, to get his horse in
motion, the beast having almost gone to sleep
during its driver's talk with Dick.</p>

<p>"Now to find Grit!" exclaimed the millionaire's
son, as he galloped on. "Poor dog, I hope they
haven't abused you very much."</p>

<p>Dick did not stop along the road to make any further
inquiries. He reached Leonardville in
good time and soon found his way to the Eagle
Hotel. He let Rex trot into the stable yard, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154">154</a></span>
dismounting, told one of the hostlers to feed and
water the animal when it had cooled off.</p>

<p>As Dick started up the steps to the porch, intending
to make some inquiries of the landlord,
he suddenly started back in surprise, for, coming
out of the main entrance, was Simon Scardale.</p>

<p>"Hello, Simon!" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"Why-er-w-w-why, hello&mdash;Dick," stammered
Simon. "Have you come to&mdash;what are you doing
here?" he managed to say, with an attempt at
pleasantry.</p>

<p>"I might ask you the same thing," responded
Dick.</p>

<p>But Simon did not wait to hear anything further.
He darted back into the hotel murmuring:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;I've forgotten something&mdash;see
you right away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He acts as though he was afraid to meet me,"
thought Dick, as he walked on. "I wonder what
he's doing here?"</p>

<p>An instant later he was surprised to see Simon
come out of a side door and fairly run to the
stables. At the same instant a man appeared in
the door of the barn, and to him Simon made
frantic gestures to remain hidden. Then, as Dick
watched this by-play with a bewildered air, there
came from the stable the bark of a dog.</p>

<p>"Grit!" exclaimed Dick. "Grit! Grit, old
boy!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155">155</a></span></p>

<p>The barks became a howl of rage and there
sounded the rattle of a chain.</p>

<p>"Grit! Grit!" cried Dick, running toward the
stable.</p>

<p>There was the noise of a chain snapping. Then
came frightened shouts. An instant later Simon,
followed by a ragged man and a youth, dashed
from the barn with the bulldog in close pursuit.
Out of the hotel yard they raced, with Grit
growling and barking and making fierce leaps for
them.</p>

<p>"Grit!" called Dick, but, for once, Grit refused
to obey his master's voice. His heart was too
full of revenge for the insults he had suffered.</p>

<p>Out into the highway ran Simon and the two
others, with the dog gaining at every leap.</p>

<p>"Help! Save me!" cried Simon, as Dick ran
out to see what the end would be. He was fearful
that Grit would get one of the fleeing ones
down and set his teeth into his throat.</p>

<p>"Grit! Grit!" he called, frantically, but the
bulldog never heeded.</p>

<p>Simon turned, hoping to get out of the path of
the maddened beast, but he did not reckon on
Grit's quickness. The dog made a grab for Simon's
trousers and caught them at the seat. There
was a ripping sound, a frantic yell from Simon,
and he fell, rolling over and over in a cloud of
dust.</p>

<p>"Grit! Don't bite him!" shouted Dick, fearful
of what might happen.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156">156</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>UNCLE EZRA'S VISIT.</h3>

<p>But Grit had no intentions of wasting time on
Simon when his revenge was not complete. He
dropped the large piece of cloth he had torn from
Simon's trousers and kept on after the two other
fleeing individuals.</p>

<p>The ragged youth was the faster runner, and
the man, lagging behind, turned as if to beat off
the dog. But Grit was fearless. Right at the
man he sprang, and the fellow gave a yell of
agony as he saw the brute launched at his throat.
But Grit was not blood-thirsty. He caught the
man by the lapel of his ragged coat, and, in an
instant, had pulled him to the ground. Then,
having worried him until the thief must have
thought he was being eaten alive, Grit left him
and set off after the third of the trio.</p>

<p>The youth was becoming exhausted, but Grit
was as fresh as ever. There was no give-up to
him. He caught the ragged lad before he had
gone a hundred feet farther and soon had him
down. He fairly tore the coat off his back, and,
after standing over him a few seconds, growling
as though he was about to tear him into little<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157">157</a></span>
pieces, Grit, with a satisfied shake of his head,
started back on the run toward Dick.</p>

<p>"Grit! Grit, old boy! So they tried to steal
you, did they?" murmured Dick, as the dog
bounded up on him and frantically licked his face.
"Well, I guess they wish they hadn't."</p>

<p>Grit nearly shook himself apart trying to wag
his stump of a tail to show his delight at again
being with his master. Dick fairly hugged his
pet, but the tears almost came to his eyes as he
saw several cruel welts on the dog's satin-like
coat, where he had been beaten.</p>

<p>"So they struck you, eh?" asked Dick, a fierce
light coming into his brown eyes. "I don't blame
you for taking after them as soon as you broke
loose. I guess I'll have a score to settle with
Simon and his cronies."</p>

<p>But there was no chance to do this. Simon
gave one look at Dick and Grit as they walked
back to the hotel. Then, trying to pull his coat
down so as to conceal the big hole in his trousers,
he hurried away up the road, after the man and
youth, who had continued their interrupted escape
as soon as they were assured that Grit had left
each two legs on which to run.</p>

<p>"Well, Grit, old boy," went on Dick, as he
entered the hotel. "I got you back without putting
any two hundred dollars under a stone at
Butternut Creek, didn't I? But I guess Henry is
entitled to his hundred of the reward. Now to
make some inquiries."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158">158</a></span></p>

<p>The landlord soon told all he knew of the case.
Late the previous night, he said, the ragged
youth and his companion had arrived at the hotel,
bringing the dog in the wagon. They said they
had purchased it and were taking it to a man in
the country. They paid for the keep of themselves
and their horse and remained all night.</p>

<p>"This morning the well-dressed young fellow
came along," went on the landlord.</p>

<p>"That was Simon," murmured Dick.</p>

<p>"He registered as Thomas Henderson," said
the hotel keeper. "I didn't much like his looks,
but I'm here to hire rooms and furnish meals to
travelers, not to criticise 'em. I was a leetle
s'prised that he seemed to know them other two,
but I thought that was his business. He seemed
to know the dog, too, but the beast didn't take
much of a notion to him. They stayed here all
day, and one of my hostlers says the dog tried
to break loose several times. They kept him
chained in the stable, and they licked him more
than once, I guess. They said he was savage and
had to be beat to make him mind."</p>

<p>"Poor Grit," murmured Dick, and the dog
barked joyfully at being again with his master.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," resumed the hotel man, "Simon, as
you call him, an' the other two, they had several
talks together. I heard 'em say suthin' about expectin'
someone with money."</p>

<p>"That was me," interposed Dick, with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159">159</a></span></p>

<p>"Only I determined to get my dog, if I could,
without paying them anything."</p>

<p>"And you did it," said the landlord, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"I did," replied Dick. "But I never suspected
Simon would try such a desperate game as this.
He must have found the leash the night of the
party," he went on, after telling the landlord what
had happened. "Then he got in with these fellows
and had them steal Grit. The letter they
mailed gave me a clue, and Henry told me enough
more to enable me to find Grit. Well, I guess I've
seen the last of Simon Scardale."</p>

<p>It was not exactly the last, but Simon did not
reappear in Hamilton Corners, and, though he
afterward played a part in Dick's life, he had
dropped out of it for the present.</p>

<p>The horse and wagon, which the man and
youth left behind, was called for that evening by
an individual of the tramp variety, but, as he
brought the cash to pay the last of the hotel bill,
the landlord let him take the rig. Dick decided
to stay at the Eagle Hotel all night, and he sent a
telegram to his father explaining his absence and
telling of his success. He decided he would not
follow up Simon or his cronies to prosecute
them for the theft.</p>

<p>As the journey was a little too long for Grit
to make afoot, and as Dick could not take him
in the saddle with him, he sent Rex home in care
of a man he hired, and engaged a carriage for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160">160</a></span>
himself and the dog, arriving home the next day
at noon.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Hamilton, as his son
came in with Grit, "your detective work was all
right."</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to Henry Darby," answered the
son. "I'm going to send him a check for a hundred
dollars," which he proceeded to do.</p>

<p>"Here are a couple of letters for you," went
on the millionaire, handing the missives to his
son. One proved to be a note from Guy Fletcher.
He had heard what had occurred regarding the
dog, for Mr. Hamilton told several friends of his
son's telegram, and Guy hastened to assure Dick
that he had no idea of Simon's scheme.</p>

<p>"He told me he was only going to play a joke
on you," wrote Guy, in the note which was delivered
by a messenger. "He took the leash from
your pocket the night of the party, and said he
was going to hide Grit and make you believe he
was stolen. I hope you don't believe I'd have
anything to do with Simon if I thought he intended
to really steal your dog. He has gone
out West, I hear, somewhere in the gold mine
region. My father has forbidden me to ever
speak to Simon again."</p>

<p>"I guess you'll not get a chance right away,"
murmured Dick.</p>

<p>The whole thing was plain to him now. Simon
wanted money, and thought he could make it by
getting the man and youth to steal Grit, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161">161</a></span>
making Dick put the two hundred dollars under
the stone. Everything had gone well up to a
certain point. The dog had been taken away,
carried in the wagon to Leonardville, and thither
Simon had gone to make the final arrangements.
The unexpected appearance of Dick had spoiled
the scheme. Simon had hurried to the barn to
warn his confederates, but at that instant Grit,
excited by a beating he was getting, had broken
loose.</p>

<p>"No," mused Dick, "I don't believe Simon will
show up around here for some time."</p>

<p>"Who is the other letter from?" asked Mr.
Hamilton.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll open it."</p>

<p>Dick rapidly scanned the contents.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ezra Larabee is coming to pay us a
visit," he announced. "He'll be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Uncle Ezra, eh?" repeated Mr. Hamilton. "I
suppose he wants to see how you are getting on&mdash;with
your investments."</p>

<p>"Hum!" exclaimed Dick, with an uneasy laugh,
"maybe he thinks the year is up and I'm to go
back with him. But it isn't&mdash;I'm glad to say."</p>

<p>"Well, we must make his visit pleasant," said
Mr. Hamilton. "It isn't often he comes to Hamilton
Corners."</p>

<p>Uncle Ezra Larabee arrived the next day.
Dick was in the library reading when he heard
the door bell ring and the butler answered it.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Hamilton in?" he heard a voice ask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162">162</a></span>
and he knew it was his uncle. The boy hastened
to greet his relative.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let us know what train you
were coming on and I would have met you with
the carriage," asked Dick, politely.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Nephew Richard," replied
Uncle Ezra, in rasping tones. "I'm not too old
to walk, and it's well to save the horse all you
can."</p>

<p>"And you carried that heavy valise?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"Of course I did, Nephew Richard. You
didn't suppose I was going to pay twenty-five
cents to have a boy carry it, did you? Lots of
them wanted to, but twenty-five cents isn't earned
every day, so I brought it myself," and with an
expression of pain that he could not conceal Mr.
Larabee set the heavy satchel down. His arm
was stiff from carrying it, but he smiled grimly
with satisfaction when he thought of the quarter
of a dollar he had saved.</p>

<p>"Come right upstairs and I'll show you to your
room," invited Dick. "Then I'll telephone father
you are here."</p>

<p>"No, no, don't waste any money telephoning,
Nephew Richard," said Uncle Ezra, hastily.</p>

<p>"Why it doesn't cost anything, uncle. We
have to pay for the telephone by the year."</p>

<p>"Well, don't do it. They might charge you
something this time. You never can tell. Besides,
you might interrupt your father in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163">163</a></span>
business deal and make him lose some money.
No, I'll wait until he comes home."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented Dick.</p>

<p>"Gracious! What's that?" exclaimed Uncle
Ezra, as a low growl came from a dark corner
by the stairs. "Have you any wild beasts in
here?"</p>

<p>"No, that's only my dog, Grit, uncle. He'll
not hurt anyone."</p>

<p>"A dog? In the house?" exclaimed Mr. Larabee.
"Why, he might chew a hole in the carpet.
Besides, I can't bear dogs. Get out, you brute!"
he exclaimed, aiming a kick at Grit, who walked
toward Dick.</p>

<p>The bulldog, with an ugly growl, crouched for
a leap at Mr. Larabee.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164">164</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>THE FRESH-AIR YOUNGSTERS.</h3>

<p>"Hold him back! Hold him! Let me hide!
He'll bite me!" exclaimed Uncle Ezra, as he saw
Grit's wicked-looking teeth.</p>

<p>"Grit!" spoke Dick, softly, and in a reproving
voice. "This is my Uncle Ezra," he went
on. "Don't you know any better than that?"</p>

<p>Instantly Grit's manner changed. He showed
that he was sorry for the mistake he had made
of growling at one of the family visitors. He
even approached Uncle Ezra as if to make friends,
but Mr. Larabee shrunk away.</p>

<p>"I can't bear dogs," he said.</p>

<p>Grit acted as if he understood, for he turned
away. Nor did he seem to miss a caress from
Mr. Larabee. Grit was a wise dog, and he well
knew that the man disliked him.</p>

<p>"If you keep that dog in the house I'm afraid
I can't stay, Nephew Richard," Dick's uncle went
on. "I wouldn't sleep a wink thinking of him."</p>

<p>"Gibbs, take Grit to the stable," said Dick to
the butler, with a little sigh, and the dog, with
a somewhat reproachful look at his master, allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165">165</a></span>
himself to be led away. Nor was he permitted
to come into the house during Uncle
Ezra's visit, which quarantine he seemed to resent,
for he always growled menacingly whenever
Mr. Larabee came near him out doors. But
this was not often, as Dick's uncle was very much
afraid of Grit.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton soon came home, and warmly
greeted his wife's brother.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," said the millionaire.
"How would you like to take a run to Hazelton
this evening to the theatre? They have a good
summer company playing there and we can make
a quick trip in Dick's runabout."</p>

<p>"I never go to theatres," said Mr. Larabee, in
severe tones. "It's sinful, and a wicked waste of
money. If there is a good instructive lecture in
the village I would much rather go to that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there isn't," replied Mr. Hamilton,
trying not to smile, for he respected his brother-in-law's
scruples. "But we can spend the evening
pleasantly at home&mdash;talking."</p>

<p>"Pleasantly!" repeated Dick to himself, with a
sort of groan. "Pleasantly, with Uncle Ezra?
Never!"</p>

<p>After supper Mr. Larabee and Dick's father
chatted in the library. The talk ranged from
business matters to subjects in Dankville, where
Mr. Hamilton knew several families.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to take a look about the
house," suggested Mr. Hamilton, after a pause<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166">166</a></span>
"I've been putting in some improvements lately,
and enlarging the conservatory. Dick will show
you around."</p>

<p>"What? Tramp through the house just to
look at it? I don't believe in doing that," replied
Uncle Ezra, firmly. "Things wear out fast
enough as it is without using them when it isn't
necessary. No use walking on the best carpets
when there isn't a need for it. Besides, I don't
believe in spending money on a house when it's
good enough. Your place was very nice without
adding to it. Think of the money you could
have saved."</p>

<p>"But I didn't have to save it," responded Mr.
Hamilton. "I made lots this year, and I thought
it was a wise thing to put it into something permanent.
I have increased the value of my house."</p>

<p>"Much better put it in the bank," advised Uncle
Ezra, with a disapproving sniff.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton and Dick tried to entertain their
visitor, but it was hard work. He cared nothing
for the things they were interested in, and was
somewhat inclined to dictate what Mr. Hamilton
should do with his money.</p>

<p>"You burn too many lights," he said, noting
that several incandescents were aglow in the library
where they sat. "One would do as well,"
and he turned out all but one.</p>

<p>"I contract for it by the year," said Mr. Hamilton.
"It doesn't cost me any more to burn five
lamps than it does one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167">167</a></span></p>

<p>"But the lamps wear out," was Uncle Ezra's
answer. "And speaking of things wearing out
reminds me. We got a letter the other day and
it almost made Samanthy sick. She hasn't got
over the shock of it yet."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Why, it was from some crazy society in New
York, wanting us to take twenty-five 'fresh-air
children,' the letter said, to board at our house
for a few weeks. Said they heard we had a big
farmhouse and could accommodate 'em."</p>

<p>"Are you going to take them?" inquired Mr.
Hamilton. "I think your house would be just
the place for them. You have lots of room, and
you can't eat all that you raise on the farm. It
would do the poor things good."</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;we&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;take&mdash;them?" repeated
Mr. Larabee. "I'm surprised at you, Mortimer
Hamilton. The idea of taking twenty-five
street-arabs in our house! Why, the very idea
of it made Samanthy sick a bed for a day. Those
rapscallions wouldn't leave a carpet on the floor!
They'd tear the house apart! I know! I've read
about 'fresh-air children' before."</p>

<p>"You might take the carpets up," suggested
Dick, with a smile.</p>

<p>"What?" almost shouted Uncle Ezra.
"Nephew Richard, there's carpets in our house
that hasn't been up for years. Why the spare
room hasn't been opened since sister Jane's funeral,
and that was&mdash;let me see&mdash;that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168">168</a></span>
year when Ruth Enderby got married. Take
'fresh-air children' into our house! Why, we
wouldn't have any house left at the end of the
week."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not as bad as that," replied Mr.
Hamilton, indulgently. "But, of course, you
know your own business best. I hope Mrs. Larabee
soon recovers."</p>

<p>"She may, but it was quite a shock," replied
Uncle Ezra. "Well, I think I'll go to bed. I
must be up early in the morning. I came here
to transact a little business, and the sooner it's
over the sooner I can get back home. I'm afraid
my hired man will burn too much kindling wood
starting the fires. He's the most wasteful man
I ever saw." And, sighing deeply at the depravity
of hired men in general and his own in particular,
Uncle Ezra went to bed.</p>

<p>Dick offered to take him for a spin in the
runabout the next day, but his uncle declined,
on the ground that there might be an accident.</p>

<p>"You might run somebody down and hurt
them," he said. "Then they'd sue you for damages
and I'd be liable for a share. I haven't any
money to throw away on automobile accidents."</p>

<p>"All right," said Dick. "But I'm very careful."</p>

<p>"You can come walking with me instead," suggested
his uncle. "You and I ought to be friends.
We may have to live together some day, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169">169</a></span>
know," and he tried to smile, but it was only a
forced grin.</p>

<p>"Not much!" thought Dick, as, with rather a
heavy heart, he prepared to accompany his uncle
on the walk. "No, no, Grit, you can't go," he
said, as the dog jumped about in delightful anticipation,
for he always went with Dick. "You
might bite Uncle Ezra," he added, as, much
against his wish, he chained Grit in the kennel.
Dick could not bear to look back at his pet, who
gazed reproachfully after him.</p>

<p>Dick showed his uncle such sights as there
were in Hamilton Corners. It was a hot day,
and, as they tramped along, Dick got quite thirsty.</p>

<p>"Come in here, Uncle Ezra," he suggested, as
they passed a drug store, "and we'll get some
soda water."</p>

<p>"What? Pay for a drink of water?" asked
Mr. Larabee, horrified.</p>

<p>"Well, it's got ice-cream in it," replied Dick.</p>

<p>"It's a sinful waste of money!" declared his
uncle. "We can get all the water we want to
drink at home. But, as I am a little thirsty, I'll
go in and ask the man for a glass of plain water.
He'll be glad to give it to us."</p>

<p>Dick was a little doubtful on this score, and
he felt that it would be rather embarrassing to
have his uncle ask for water in the drug store,
where Dick was well known. But he was too
polite to object to what Mr. Larabee did. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170">170</a></span>
latter walked into the store, and, in his rasping
voice, asked for two glasses of water.</p>

<p>"Do you mean soda water?" inquired the clerk.</p>

<p>"No, plain water. I don't drink such trash as
soda water," replied Mr. Larabee.</p>

<p>The clerk looked at him in much astonishment,
and then glanced at Dick. The latter managed
to wink, and the clerk seemed to understand.
He went to the back part of the store, and presently
came back with two glasses of water.</p>

<p>"There, nephew," said Mr. Larabee, triumphantly,
as he sipped the plain beverage. "You see
our thirst is quenched and we have saved our
money. Young men should economize, and when
they are old they will not want."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Dick, dutifully, but when
they went out he managed to lay ten cents on
the counter where the clerk would see it. Dick
wasn't going to be made fun of the next time
he went in for a glass of soda.</p>

<p>"Now, I think we'll go home, Nephew Richard,"
suggested Mr. Larabee, when they had
walked an hour longer. "There is no use wearing
out our shoes any more than we can help. Besides,
I have some business to transact this afternoon,
and I must get the papers out of my valise."</p>

<p>Dick was glad enough to return, and gladder
still, when, the next morning, Uncle Ezra announced
that he was going back to Dankville.</p>

<p>"You must come and see me and your Aunt
Samantha," he said to Dick, as he bade the lad<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171">171</a></span>
good-bye, and Dick murmured something that
might be taken as an expression of a fervent desire
to pay another visit to The Firs, but it was
not.</p>

<p>"Dad," said Dick that night, "do you know
what I'm thinking of?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, you think of so many things."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of those poor little fresh-air
kids, and how disappointed they must be not to
get a trip to the country. I don't know as I want
them to go to Uncle Ezra's, but&mdash;er&mdash;say, dad,
I'd like to give a bunch of fresh-air kids some
sort of an outing. Think of the poor little tots
shut up in sizzling New York this kind of
weather."</p>

<p>"Well, you can bring them here, I suppose,"
began Mr. Hamilton, doubtfully, with a look
around his handsomely furnished house, "only
this isn't exactly the country."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean here," said Dick, hastily.
"I was thinking we could have a crowd of 'em
out to Sunnyside."</p>

<p>This was the name of a large farm which Mr.
Hamilton owned on the outskirts of the country
village of Prattville.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Mr. Hamilton,
with as much fervor as Dick had shown. "That's
the ticket, Dick. I'll write to Foster at once and
ask him if he and his wife can take a crowd of
the waifs at Sunnyside for a few weeks. Then
you will have to manage the other end yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172">172</a></span>
Foster will do as I say, I guess, for he loves children
and he has a heart as big as a barrel. You'll
have to furnish the children."</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" exclaimed Dick, delightedly. "I'll
write to Uncle Ezra and ask him the address of
that committee in New York. Hurrah for the
fresh-air kids! I hope they have a good time!"</p>

<p>"I guess they will if he has anything to do
with it," mused Mr. Hamilton, with a fond look
at his son as Dick went to get writing material
to pen a letter to Uncle Ezra.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173">173</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>TIM'S DISCLOSURE</h3>

<p>Two days later Dick received a reply from Mr.
Larabee. In the meanwhile Mr. Hamilton had
written to Foster, the man he hired to take charge
of Sunnyside farm, and had told him to have the
place in readiness for twenty-five youngsters.</p>

<p>"Did your Uncle Ezra give you the address of
the Fresh-Air Committee?" asked Dick's father.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he sent me a letter of advice along
with it."</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"I'll read it to you," and Dick turned over the
pages of the missive. "This is what he says
about my plan of trying to give those kids a little
fun:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"'I send you the address of the committee, as
you requested, but, Nephew Richard, I want to
warn you against taking them. In the first place,
they will be no better off than they are at home.
They will not appreciate what you do for them.
Then, too, they might bring some terrible epidemic
to this part of the country. Sunnyside is
not so far from Dankville but that a disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174">174</a></span>
might carry to my place, and you know my health
is not strong.</p>

<p>"'If I had control of you (as I may have some
day), I would not let you do this. But it is not
for me to say at this time what you should do. I
think you are throwing the money away, and you
had much better put the amount you intend spending
into the church missionary box and so aid the
heathens. They need it.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As if those poor kids in the hot tenements of
New York didn't need it, too," commented Dick.
"Well, Uncle Ezra is certainly a queer man. I
suppose he'll keep his house filled with disinfectants
while the waifs are at Sunnyside, though it's
many miles away."</p>

<p>In about a week Dick had completed arrangements
with the committee in New York, the
president of which wrote to thank him for aiding
in the work they were doing. Dick was told
that twenty-five youngsters, ten boys and fifteen
girls, none of whom had ever been to the country
before, would be sent to Sunnyside in charge of a
matron. Dick had forwarded money to buy the
tickets, and had planned with Foster to have a
big stage meet the train on which the "fresh-air
kids," as he called them, would arrive at the
nearest station to the country home.</p>

<p>"Well, dad," remarked Dick, the day before
the waifs from New York were to arrive, "you've
seen the last of me for a week."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"Why; where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Sunnyside. I want to see that the kids
are started right, and I think I'll stay about a
week to see that they have a good time. I'll take
my runabout, and I can come back in a hurry if
I need to. I'll bring a batch over to see you,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Do," said Mr. Hamilton. "I like children.
Poor things! I hope the trip to the country does
them good."</p>

<p>Dick had read about fresh-air children who
were much impressed by their first visit to the
country, but this did not prepare him for the
awed look on the faces of the twenty-five as they
tumbled from the train at the little country depot,
and made for the waiting stage.</p>

<p>"Now, children," said the matron, as Dick
came up and introduced himself, "this is the
gentleman who was so kind as to bring you out
to this beautiful place," and she shook hands with
the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"Is dat de rich guy?" asked one boy, but
though his words might sound disrespectful he
did not intend them so.</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed a girl in a much-patched
red dress. "He'll hear you."</p>

<p>"What do I care! If I wuz as rich as him I
wouldn't care who knowed it," retorted the boy.</p>

<p>"No more do I, old chap," replied Dick, with
a laugh, as he patted the youngster on the back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176">176</a></span>
"Now, boys and girls, the stage is waiting for
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nellie!" cried a little tot with light hair,
"we're goin' to ride in a real wagon with real
horses!"</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud!" was the whispered answer
of her companion. "It's like a dream, an'
maybe we'll wake up an' find it all gone."</p>

<p>The children, in spite of the fact that they
came from the slums of New York, were all neat
and clean, for that was one of the requirements
of the committee that took charge of the fresh-air
work. And, though their manners might be
considered a little rough, they did not intend
them so. It was due to the influence of their
surroundings. Soon they had all piled into the
stage, and the driver from Sunnyside started
the four horses.</p>

<p>"Look, will yer! It's a regular tally-ho like de
swells on Fif' Avenoo drives!" exclaimed the boy
who had called Dick the "rich guy."</p>

<p>The ride to the farm was one continuous series
of exclamations of delight from the boys and
girls, who looked at the green fields on either
side of the country road, at the comfortable farmhouses
they passed, or at the range of mountains
that towered off to the west.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed one boy, who had kept
tight hold of his sister's hand from the time he
got off the train. "See, Maggie, that's where the
sun goes to sleep. I never saw it before."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177">177</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Over there," and he pointed to the mountains
behind which the golden orb was sinking to rest.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," spoke the matron, who had overheard
what was said, "and in the morning he'll
get up and shine on the fields where you can
run around and get strong.</p>

<p>"He's a sickly child," the matron added in a
whisper to Dick. "I'm afraid he never will be
strong. He has such queer fancies at times. His
mother is a widow and goes out washing. The
sister stays home and takes care of her little
brother. It was a real charity that they could
come, and I'm sure the committee doesn't know
how to thank you for your generosity."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! That's nothing," replied Dick,
blushing like a girl at the praise. "I ought to do
something with my money. I'm glad I heard
about this fresh-air plan. I'll have some of the
youngsters out next year if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped. He happened to think that
if his investments did not succeed he would not
have much money to spend the next year, and, besides,
he might be living with his Uncle Ezra at
Dankville.</p>

<p>But the matron did not notice his hesitation,
for, at that moment, the stage turned into the
drive leading up to Sunnyside, and Dick was besieged
by several inquiries.</p>

<p>"Say, mister, is dis a park?" asked one boy,
as he saw the well-kept drive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"No, this is the place where you are going
to stay," Dick replied.</p>

<p>"Can we get out an' walk?" asked another,
and this seemed to strike a popular chord, for
that request became general. The matron nodded
an assent and the children jumped out of the
stage, some boys going by way of the windows.</p>

<p>"You can drive on and tell them we are coming,"
said Dick to the driver.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they'll know it fast enough," responded
the man, with a grin. "You can hear
them kids a mile."</p>

<p>Which was true enough, for the boys and girls
were fairly yelling in pure delight. Dick and
the matron walked on behind the crowd, the millionaire's
son watching with interest the antics of
the waifs.</p>

<p>"Johnny! Johnny!" yelled a slip of a girl to
her bigger brother. "Come right off the grass
this minute! Do youse want a cop to put you
out? He don't know no better, mister," she said,
turning to Dick. "He didn't mean nothin'.
Johnny, do you hear me? Come off that grass
right away, or the man will have youse arrested."</p>

<p>"No, no! Nothing of the sort!" exclaimed
Dick, with a laugh. "You can eat the grass if
you want to. Do just as you please. There isn't
a policeman within twenty miles."</p>

<p>Then there was a mad rush over the big lawn
that led up to Sunnyside. The children yelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179">179</a></span>
laughed, shouted, and fairly tumbled over each
other in the very joy of being in the country.
Pale cheeks reddened as the little lungs breathed
in the pure, fresh air, dull eyes lighted up with
pleasure, and little hands trembled with eagerness
as they plucked buttercups, dandelions and daisies
that grew on the far edges of the lawns.</p>

<p>"Wow!" yelled one lad. "Wow! I've got to
do somethin' or I'll bust!"</p>

<p>And that is the way most of them felt it
seemed, for they raced, ran, jumped and tumbled
like children just let out after being kept in after
school.</p>

<p>And such a supper as Mrs. Foster had provided
for the waifs! Their eyes bulged as they
came to the table that was fairly groaning under
the weight of good things.</p>

<p>"Now," called Dick, when they sat down, "let
me see how you can eat."</p>

<p>"They do not need any coaxing," replied the
matron, and Dick soon saw that she was right.</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of a happy two
weeks for the youngsters. They fairly went
wild on the farm, for it had a hundred delights
for them, from watching the cows being
milked, to hunting for eggs in the big barn.
Dick took them for automobile rides in relays,
bringing several over to Hamilton Corners to see
his father, who further delighted the childish
hearts by gifts of dimes and nickels. On one of
these trips the millionaire's son brought Tim Muldoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180">180</a></span>
the boy who had commented on Dick's
riches that day the two met.</p>

<p>"An' does your governor own dat bank?" Tim
asked, as Dick stopped the runabout in front of
the institution.</p>

<p>"Well, most of it, I guess."</p>

<p>"An' can he go in dere an' git money whenever
he wants it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess he can."</p>

<p>"Say!" exclaimed Tim, as he looked weakly
at Dick, "an youse is his son?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"An' youse is takin' me an' dese (indicating
some of the other youngsters) out fer a ride in
dis gasolene gig? Us what ain't got a cent?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?" asked Dick, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got t' say is dat dis is as near
bein' rich as I ever expects t' be, an' say, it's dead
white of youse; dat's what it is. Why, dem rich
guys in N' York would no more t'ink of treatin'
us dis way dan dey would jump off de dock. Dat's
straight!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they would if they thought about
it, but they probably don't know how many boys
and girls would like to get out and see the country,"
said Dick, not wanting to take too much
credit to himself.</p>

<p>"Like pie!" was Tim's contemptuous rejoinder.
Then, as he was gazing rapturously at the entrance
to the bank, he suddenly started as he saw
a man coming down the steps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"Say," he whispered to Dick, grabbing his arm,
"is dat guy in your governor's bank?"</p>

<p>"Which man? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean dat one wid de black moustache, jest
comin' down de steps. Is he in de bank?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Mr. Vanderhoof," replied Dick,
recognizing the mining promoter.</p>

<p>"Mr. who?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"Vanderhoof. Why, do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Not by dat name. But say, if he's got anyt'ing
to do wit de bank it'll soon be on de blink."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean put out of business. On de blink, excuse
my slang. But youse had better tell your
governor to keep his peepers open."</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired Dick, a vague suspicion coming
into his mind.</p>

<p>"Because," replied Tim, earnestly. "Dat man's
name ain't Vanderhoof any more dan mine is."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's William Jackson, or Bond Broker
Bill. I seen him in de police court in N' York.
I sells papers, an' I knows lots of de cops an' detectives.
I saw 'em arrest dat man once, only he
had a white beard an' moustache den. Now he's
shaved off de whiskers an' colored his moustache,
but I knowed him de minute I set me peepers on
him. I seen his mug in de papers lots of times.
Youse wants to be on lookout fer him or he'll
put de bank on de blink. He's a gold-brick<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182">182</a></span>
swindler, an' I guess up to any other woozy game
he can make pay!"</p>

<p>"Bond Broker Bill! William Jackson! Colonel
Dendon!" murmured Dick, in a daze. "No wonder
I thought I had seen Mr. Vanderhoof before.
It was in the New York hotel, where he tried to
swindle me! And he sold dad and me some gold
mining stock! I must tell dad right away!"</p>

<p>Dick looked after the retreating form of Mr.
Vanderhoof. Then turning to Tim, who had
made the startling disclosure, he said:</p>

<p>"Wait here for me! I must see my father at
once," and getting out of the auto he hurried into
the bank.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183">183</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH MR. VANDERHOOF VANISHES</h3>

<p>Dick found his father busy, looking over some
books and papers. He waited until the millionaire
had finished and looked up, remarking:</p>

<p>"Well, Dick, what is it now? Some more of
the fresh-air kids outside?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dad, but I've got something more important
to tell you than about them. Was Mr.
Vanderhoof just in here?"</p>

<p>"He was, and I took some more stock in the
Hop Toad Mine. I had an additional report
from the government assayer at Yazoo City, and
the ore is richer than ever."</p>

<p>"You bought more stock, dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because that man is a swindler! I just
learned of it! His name is not Vanderhoof at
all. He's the same man who tried to swindle me
in New York. He goes by the name of Colonel
Dendon. I thought there was something familiar
about him the first day I saw him in here, but I
couldn't place him on account of his dyed moustache.
He's a swindler!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"Tim Muldoon, one of the fresh-air children.
He saw him under arrest in New York. Probably
he got out on bail. Oh, dad, I'm afraid we've
both been swindled!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't get excited," counseled Mr. Hamilton,
who was used to facing business troubles.
"He may be a swindler, but I think our mining
stock is good. The reports of it are all from
reliable men. But I'll make an investigation at
once."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"I think I'll send for Mr. Vanderhoof and ask
him to explain. We'll have your friend Tim in
here. No doubt it is all a mistake. I wouldn't
place too much faith in what a boy says."</p>

<p>"You don't know Tim," responded Dick.
"He's as bright as they make 'em. I guess all
New York newsboys are. But where does Mr.
Vanderhoof live?"</p>

<p>"He is stopping at the Globe Hotel. He told
me he would remain in town about two weeks
longer, as he had some business to transact. I'll
just call up the hotel and ask him to come here.
Meanwhile, tell Tim to come in."</p>

<p>"Don't 'phone, dad," advised Dick. "I'll run
down to the hotel in my auto. If you call him
on the wire he may suspect something. I'll bring
him here in the machine."</p>

<p>"All right, Dick. Maybe that's a good plan.
But don't get excited. Be calm. This may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185">185</a></span>
only a boy's excited imagination. Mr. Vanderhoof
certainly seemed like a business man and
not like a swindler. Of course, I may be fooled.
I have been, once or twice, in my time, but you've
got to take those chances. However, we'll not
decide anything until we talk to him. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"What will I do with the youngsters?" asked
Dick. "I've got five of them with me."</p>

<p>"Give 'em a quarter apiece and let 'em buy ice-cream,"
advised the millionaire, with a laugh.
"That is, all but Tim. Let him come in here and
wait."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents' worth of ice-cream each
would put them all in the hospital," explained
Dick. "I'll make 'em distribute their wealth,"
and, in a few moments he had sent the four boys
off to see the sights of the town, happy in the
possession of a quarter of a dollar each, and with
strict injunctions not to get lost, and to be back
at the bank in an hour.</p>

<p>"Me to go inside de bank?" asked Tim, when
Dick told him what was wanted. "Say, I'm gittin'
real swell, I am! If de kids on Hester Street
could see me now dey'd t'ink I was president of
a railroad," and, with a laugh he went into Mr.
Hamilton's private office. While Dick was gone
the millionaire questioned the newsboy, who stuck
to his story that the man he had seen was a
swindler, who had been under arrest in New
York.</p>

<p>Dick made fast time to the Globe Hotel. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186">186</a></span>
he jumped from the auto, and hurried inside, the
manager, who knew him, nodded a greeting.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Vanderhoof about?" asked Dick, trying
to keep his voice calm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vanderhoof?" repeated the manager.
"No, he went out a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why, he said he was going back to New
York," was the rather surprising answer. "A
telegram came for him as soon as he got here and
he left in a hurry. He just caught the express,
and didn't even have time to take his baggage.
He paid me his bill and rushed out in a hurry,
telling me he'd send word where to forward his
trunk. Did you want to see him about anything
important?"</p>

<p>"It was, but I guess it will keep," replied Dick,
trying not to show any alarm.</p>

<p>His worst fears were realized. Vanderhoof,
<i>alias</i> Bond Broker Bill, had been warned by some
confederates, perhaps, and had fled, after securing
large sums of money from Dick and his
father.</p>

<p>"And maybe we're not the only victims,"
thought Dick, as he left the hotel and turned the
auto toward the bank.</p>

<p>"Well, what luck?" asked Mr. Hamilton, as his
son entered.</p>

<p>"He's skipped out, dad!"</p>

<p>"He has, eh? Now to find out how badly we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187">187</a></span>
have been bitten. Dick, my boy, it looks as
though there was a hoodoo hanging over your
investments. Still, this mine stock may be all
right. I'll wire to a lawyer in Yazoo City."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a foxy guy, is Bond Broker Bill,"
said Tim, when Dick told him what had taken
place. "I wish I'd a spotted him before. Maybe
he seen me an' flew de coop."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe he would have known you
were on his trail," replied Dick, with an uneasy
laugh. "I think he left on general principles."</p>

<p>It was several hours before Mr. Hamilton received
a reply from the lawyer in Yazoo City,
Nevada. When it came the telegram stated that
the Hop Toad and Dolphin mines were producing
a quantity of ore, and were generally believed to
be good mines.</p>

<p>"Not much known about them here, though,"
the telegram went on. "Would advise a personal
inspection. Believed that some promotor has a
lot of stock and is trying to sell it in the East.
Better look into it."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a chance yet," said Mr. Hamilton.
"As I said, Vanderhoof may be a swindler,
but the mines seem to be good. I'll have someone
right on the ground look them up. We must
make our plans carefully."</p>

<p>"Whom will you get, dad?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. I must write to this lawyer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"Dad!" exclaimed Dick, suddenly. "Let me
take a trip out West! Let me look up those
mines! If they're no good I want to know it
soon, so I can make some other investment. Can't
I go to Nevada?"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189">189</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>OFF FOR THE WEST</h3>

<p>Mr. Hamilton glanced at his son. Dick was
all excited over the events of the last hour and
by the sudden desire that had come to him.</p>

<p>"You go to Nevada?" repeated the millionaire.</p>

<p>"Yes, dad, and look up this mining business.
I could see the lawyer and find out whether we
have been swindled. The trip would do me
good," he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I haven't any doubt of that, Dick," replied his
father. "And, after thinking it over, I don't know
but you could make whatever investigation would
be needed. I think I'll let you go. How soon can
you be ready?"</p>

<p>"To-night."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no such rush as that. If we've
been swindled, finding it out now isn't going to
help matters any. If, on the other hand, as I
hope may be the case, the mines are all right,
there's no need of hurrying out there. You'd
better make good preparations for the trip. It
isn't going to be much fun traveling alone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"But, dad, I needn't travel alone. I was thinking
I could take some of my chums with me.
Bricktop, Frank Bender and Walter Mead would
think it bully fun to go along. Why couldn't I
take them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you could if their parents did not
object. They would be your guests, of course&mdash;that
is, you would have to pay all expenses."</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to. I've got two thousand dollars
invested in the Dolphin mine, and I've got
to spend some more to see if I've thrown that
money away. I might as well have some fun out
of it, if I can."</p>

<p>"Four lads will make a nice party. I'll have
McIverson go to the depot and get some time-tables.
Meanwhile you had better get the fresh-air
boys back to Sunnyside. It's getting near
supper-time, and the matron may be worried
about them."</p>

<p>"Say, is youse really goin' out where they make
gold mines?" asked Tim Muldoon, as he and Dick
went back to the automobile, around which the
other lads, having spent all their money, and seen
all the sights, were waiting. "Are youse goin'
out West among de Indians an' cowboys?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, but I guess there aren't any Indians
left."</p>

<p>"Sure dere is! Didn't I read about in a book?
It's a crackerjack! I'll lend it to youse. It's
'Three-Fingered Harry; or, De Scourge of de
Redskins!'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thanks," answered Dick, with a laugh.
"I wouldn't read such trash if I were you. There
are very few Indians left out West and they're
too scarce to kill off."</p>

<p>"Well," spoke Tim, with a sigh, "it's in de
book. Say," he added, "does it cost much to go
out West?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure just how much it does
take, but I guess it's rather costly."</p>

<p>Tim sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"I've got three dollars an' nineteen cents salted
down in de dime savings bank," replied the newsboy.
"I was savin' it fer a new overcoat, but I'd
rather go out West. How far could I go fer
three dollars an' nineteen cents? Could I travel
wit youse as far as it lasted?"</p>

<p>The boy looked wistfully at Dick, and there
was a world of longing in the blue eyes of Tim
Muldoon as they met the brown orbs of the millionaire's
son. Then Dick came to a sudden resolve.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go with me and the other
boys?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Would I? Say, Mr. Dick, would a cat eat
clams? Would I? Don't spring dat on me
agin," he added, with an attempt at a laugh. "I've
got a weak heart an' I might faint. It's back to
little ole N' York an' Hester Street fer mine, I
guess."</p>

<p>"No," said Dick. "I mean it. You may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192">192</a></span>
rendered me and my father a great service, Tim,
in telling us about Vanderhoof. If he proves
to be what you say he is, a swindler, it is a good
thing we found it out when we did. We may be
able to save some of our money. If you can arrange
to go I'll take you out West with me. Do
you think you can?"</p>

<p>"Can I go? Well, I should say I can. Where's
me ticket? I ain't got no trunk to pack."</p>

<p>"But what will your folks say?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got no folks, Mr. Dick. I'm all dere
is," and, though he spoke flippantly, there was
a suspicion of tears in Tim's eyes.</p>

<p>"Then, if the matron who brought you here
says it is all right, you shall go," decided Dick.</p>

<p>Dick was actuated by two motives. He wanted
to give pleasure to the little waif, to whom he
had taken a great liking, and he also felt that
Tim might be of service to him. If Vanderhoof
turned up out in Nevada, it might be well
to have Tim on hand to confront him. Then, too,
Tim was a bright, quick lad, and Dick felt he
would be useful on the trip.</p>

<p>Dick returned his charges to Sunnyside, and
the matron, after hearing of the plans for the
western trip, readily consented that Tim should
go. He was an orphan, she explained, who had
been taken in charge by a philanthropic society
in New York. The boy was good-hearted and
honest, she said, and had proved that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193">193</a></span>
be trusted. While his talk might be a bit rough
and slangy a true heart beat under Tim's patched
but neat jacket.</p>

<p>In spite of the prospective trip Dick did not
forget the fresh-air children. It was found that
it would require several days to get the through
tickets for Yazoo City, and, in the meanwhile,
the millionaire's son arranged for a big outdoor
clambake for the youngsters. He and the three
boys, whom he had invited to make the long journey
with him, attended, and helped the waifs to
have a good time&mdash;if they needed such assistance,
which was doubtful.</p>

<p>Then, after arranging for another lot of the
little unfortunates to come to Sunnyside when the
first crowd had reached New York, Dick bade
good-bye to those into whose lives he had been
able to bring much happiness because of his
wealth.</p>

<p>Tim was taken to the Hamilton mansion, where
he was fitted up in a manner that made him think
he had fallen heir to some vast treasure, such as
those he read about in dime novels.</p>

<p>"If me Hester Street friends could see me
now," he murmured, as he looked at the new
suit Dick had bought him, "dey would sure take
me for a swell."</p>

<p>"Don't think too much of good clothes,"
warned Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, it's de first time I ever had any to t'ink
about," replied Tim, "an' youse must let me look<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194">194</a></span>
at dem till I gits used to 'em," which Dick laughingly
agreed to do.</p>

<p>"I hear you're going out West," remarked
Henry Darby to Dick, when he met him on the
street the day before that set for the start.</p>

<p>"Yes. Going to look up some gold mines,"
and Dick laughed.</p>

<p>"If you find any lying around loose, or one that
no one else wants&mdash;or even an old one that someone
has thrown away&mdash;why just express it back
to me," requested Henry. "I'd rather have a
good gold mine than this old metal business, I
think."</p>

<p>"How is it going?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Pretty well. Say, I don't think I ought to
keep that hundred-dollar check you sent me for
telling you that I'd seen Grit in the man's
wagon."</p>

<p>"Of course you've got to keep it!" exclaimed
Dick. "I would have paid it to the first person
who gave me the right clue, and I'm sure I
couldn't give it to anyone I like better than you."</p>

<p>"It certainly came in mighty handy," said
Henry.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I had a chance to buy up the refuse from an
old boiler factory just before I got it and I hadn't
any cash. Dad had taken all the surplus. He's
got some scheme on hand, and he won't tell me
what it is. He says there's lots of money in it.
There may be," went on Henry, with an odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195">195</a></span>
smile, "but what's worrying me is whether dad
is going to get the money out of it. That's mostly
the trouble with his schemes. There's thousands
of dollars in 'em, but the cash generally stays
there for all of him. But maybe this one will
turn out all right. I hope so, because he's got
all the surplus. But I used the hundred dollars
to buy some old iron, and I think I can dispose
of it at a profit. Well, I hope you have good
luck."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered Dick. "I'll remember
what you said about a gold mine."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll not insist on a gold mine," called
back Henry, as he started his horse up, a task
that required some time, for the animal seemed
to take advantage of every stop to go to sleep.
"I'm not prejudiced in favor of a gold mine. A
good-paying silver mine will do pretty nearly as
well."</p>

<p>"I'll remember, Henry. Good-bye until I get
back."</p>

<p>Early the next morning Dick and his four boy
friends were on their way to the West. Their
train was an express and the first stop was at a
large city, where several railroads formed a junction.
As the boys were looking from the window
of the parlor car, Tim, who managed to
take his eyes away from the gorgeous fittings
long enough to notice what was going on up and
down the long station platform, suddenly uttered
an exclamation, and grabbed Dick's arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Look! Dere he is!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Vanderhoof! Colonel Dendon! Bond Broker
Bill!"</p>

<p>"Where? I don't see anyone."</p>

<p>"Dat slick-lookin' man, wid de brown hat on,"
and Tim pointed to him.</p>

<p>"But he hasn't any black moustache," objected
Dick, thinking Tim's imagination was getting the
best of him.</p>

<p>"Of course not. He's cut it off. But I'd know
him anywhere by dat scar on his left cheek. Dat's
de swindler all right!"</p>

<p>As Dick looked he saw that the man with the
brown hat did have a large scar on his cheek. It
had been hidden by the moustache before.</p>

<p>Then, just as the train pulled out, the man
looked toward the parlor car. His eyes met
Dick's, and, an instant later, the man with the
scar was on the run toward the telegraph office.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197">197</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>AT THE MINES</h3>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Dick, jumping up. "Stop the
train!"</p>

<p>The cars were rapidly acquiring speed, and
Dick ran toward the door with the evident intention
of getting off.</p>

<p>"Don't jump, Dick!" called Walter Mead.
"We're going too fast!"</p>

<p>"Dat's right," chimed in Tim. "It's too late!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess it is," assented Dick. "But, Tim,
how do you know that was Vanderhoof? To me
he didn't look a bit like him. Besides, how did
you know he had a scar under his moustache?"</p>

<p>"I've seen him wid his whiskers an' moustache
off before," replied the newsboy. "I used to run
errands for de sleuths at police headquarters, an'
I seen lots of criminals."</p>

<p>"But are you sure you saw this man there?"</p>

<p>"Cert. He was brought in lots of times fer
some kind of crooked game, but most times he
was let go, 'cause they couldn't prove anyt'ing
agin him. Sometimes he'd have a white beard
an' agin a black moustache, but dem fly cops, dem<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198">198</a></span>
gum-shoe sleuths, dey knowed him every time.
I'll stake me reputation dat was him on de platform."</p>

<p>"But what can he be doing here?" asked Dick,
"and why should he make a bee-line for the telegraph
office when he saw me? I'm positive he
knew who I was."</p>

<p>"Course he did," replied Tim. "He's probably
sendin' a telegram to some of his friends in Yazoo
City t' be on de lookout for youse."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? But how would he know I
had started for there?"</p>

<p>"Say," inquired Tim, in drawling tones, "don't
de hull town where you live know dat Millionaire
Hamilton's son is goin' off on a journey in a palace
car, an' takin' some friends, includin' Tim
Muldoon, wid him? In course dey does. An'
youse can bet your bottom dollar dat everybody
in Hamilton Corners is talkin' about it. Vanderhoof,
or Bond Broker Bill, knowed it as soon as
anybody, an' if he's been puttin' up a crooked deal
he's gittin' ready t' fix t'ings on de other end&mdash;at
Yazoo City, I mean."</p>

<p>"Then, if he has warned his confederates out
West," went on Dick, "there's not much use in
my going there to make an investigation. They'd
be sure to have things fixed up to deceive me. I
depended on finding out about the mines before
those in charge knew who I was."</p>

<p>"You can do dat yet," said Tim.</p>

<p>"How?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, lay low, dat's how. Don't go out dere
wid de idea of handin' your visitin' card t' every
guy you meet. Drift int' town easy like an' look
about on de quiet fer a few days. Den youse kin
see how de land lays an' git a line on de fakers.
After dat youse can go up to de villain like de
hero does in de play an' say: 'Now den, Red-Handed
Mike, I have caught youse at last! You
shall give me dose paper-r-r-r-s er I'll shoot you
down like a dog!'" and Tim laughed with the
others at his imitation of the methods of the
actors on the stage when a cheap melodrama is
being performed.</p>

<p>"I don't know but your advice is good," agreed
Dick. "I can't catch Vanderhoof now, but perhaps
we can spoil his plans. Let's have a consultation
and decide what's best to do."</p>

<p>The boys had the parlor car pretty much to
themselves, and their talk was not likely to be
overheard by the other passengers who were in
the farther end.</p>

<p>The journey was a pleasant one, and the boys
enjoyed every hour of it. The country through
which they passed presented, almost constantly,
something new in the way of scenery, and as they
proceeded farther and farther west the boys
were wild with delight at the beautiful prospect,
the wild stretches of country and the glimpses
of the free life on the plains.</p>

<p>Sleeping in the berths, eating in the dining-car
and looking out of the windows of the big Pullman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200">200</a></span>
were keen delights to Dick's companions,
none of whom had ever traveled in such a fashion
before, though to the millionaire's son it was
more or less familiar.</p>

<p>When they reached the last stage of their
journey and were within a few hours' ride of
Yazoo City the five boys, at Tim's suggestion,
changed from the parlor car to an ordinary one.</p>

<p>"It'll look better t' climb down out of a poor
man's car dan from de coach wid de velvet curtains
at de windows," he said. "Students ain't
supposed t' be lookin' fer places t' t'row money
away." For they had agreed to pass themselves
off as students, come West to look at mines in
general.</p>

<p>Thus it was that no unusual comments were
made by the crowd at the station in Yazoo City
when the five boys and a few other passengers
alighted from the train.</p>

<p>It was a typical Western town, rather larger
than an ordinary one, for it was the centre for a
prosperous mining section. Across from the
station were two hotels, one called the Imperial
Inn and the other the Royal Hotel.</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem to be much choice," observed
Frank Bender. "Neither one looks as if royalty
was in the habit of stopping at it."</p>

<p>"We'll go to the Royal," decided Dick. "The
lawyer, whom dad wrote to about the mine, stops
there, and I want to see him."</p>

<p>Accordingly the five boys walked across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201">201</a></span>
street and entered the lobby of the hotel. It was
even less pretentious on the inside than viewed
from without, but it looked clean. Dick led the
way up to the desk, to engage rooms for himself
and friends.</p>

<p>"Glad t' see you, strangers," greeted the man
behind the desk with easy familiarity. "What
might yo' uns be, if I might make so bold as to
ask? Travelin' show or capitalists lookin' fer a
good payin' mine?"</p>

<p>"We're studying mining conditions," replied
Dick. "Traveling for information."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," interrupted the hotel proprietor,
who also acted as clerk. "We've had some of
you college boys out here before. Welcome to
Yazoo City," and Dick and his companions were
glad that the man had put his own interpretation
on their object in coming West. He swung the
book around to them and Dick signed first. The
pen was poor and the ink worse, so it was no
wonder that his name, when he had scratched it
down, looked like anything but Dick Hamilton.
Nor did the others do any better.</p>

<p>They were shown to their rooms, and, as it
was late afternoon, they decided to defer beginning
their investigations until the next day. The
supper was good but plain, though the boys were
more interested in watching the men about them,
and hearing them talk, than they were in eating,
hungry as they were.</p>

<p>They slept soundly, though Dick was awak<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202">202</a></span>ened
once or twice by revolver shots and loud
yelling. He thought someone had been hurt, but
on inquiring from a porter, passing through the
hall, learned that he need have no cause for
alarm.</p>

<p>"Land love yo', son!" said the porter, a burly
Westerner. "Them's only th' boys gittin' rid of
some of their animal spirits. Don't worry none.
They seldom shoots this way, an' if they does
they aims high, so they only busts the top window
lights. Yo' ain't got nothin' t' be askeered
of."</p>

<p>But though Dick was not exactly easy in his
mind his rest was not disturbed by any bullets
coming through his window, though there was
considerable shooting all night.</p>

<p>"I think we'll take a trip out to the mines right
after breakfast," decided Dick, when the boys
had gathered in his room after dressing. "I'll
hire a big carriage and we can all go. I inquired
about them, and I learned that the Dolphin and
Hop Toad mines are close together, a few miles
outside of town."</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay around here," decided Tim.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Because I want to see if anyt'ing happens.
Youse kin go out to de holes in de ground. I'll
see 'em later if dere worth lookin' at. But I
t'ink I'll mosey around de hotel a while."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it will be a good plan," agreed
Dick. "We can't tell what sort of a game Vanderhoof<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203">203</a></span>
is up to. Now, come on down to breakfast,
boys."</p>

<p>After the meal Dick hired a large three-seated
buckboard, and he and his chums were driven off
toward the mines. The news had quickly gone
around that they were young college students,
who had come West to get practical illustrations
bearing on their studies.</p>

<p>Tim stood on the hotel steps looking after
Dick and his chums. As the carriage disappeared
around a turn in the road someone came
up to the newsboy and tapped him on the shoulder.
He turned quickly and saw, standing beside him,
a well-dressed lad about his own age. The youth
wore a showy watch chain and assumed a confident
air that was not at all in keeping with his
years.</p>

<p>"How's my friend, Dick Hamilton?" he asked,
nodding in the direction of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Dick Hamilton," spoke Tim, in a sort of
daze.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick Hamilton, of Hamilton Corners.
I suppose he came out here to see about the mines
he and his millionaire father invested in."</p>

<p>"Mines," repeated Tim, somewhat surprised to
thus learn that Dick's object was already discovered.</p>

<p>"Yes, mines," went on the other youth. "Oh,
I know all about it. Dick thought he was cute,
pretending to come here with a bunch of college
lads. But I'm on to him, and so are the others."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Tim, boldly.</p>

<p>"Just tell Dick that Simon Scardale was asking
for him," replied the flashily-dressed youth, as he
moved away. "I'll not give him my address, because
I don't believe he'd like to call on me, but
just tell him Simon Scardale was asking for him,"
and, with a mocking bow, Simon jumped on a
pony and galloped off down the street.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205">205</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT TRIP</h3>

<p>Dick and his chums saw many interesting
sights on their drive to the mines. All about
them were evidences of the hustling West, and
the noise of the stamping mills, or machines,
which crush up the rocks and ore to enable the
precious metals to be extracted from them could
be heard on every side. They met many teams
hauling ore from the mines to distant "stamps,"
and saw throngs of miners in their rough, but
picturesque, garb, tramping along.</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll let us visit the mines?"
asked Dick of the driver. "We want to find out
all we can about 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess so. This is a free and easy country.
Visitors are always welcome, providin' they
don't want to know too much," and the driver
winked his eye.</p>

<p>"Too much?" repeated Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes. Lots of men out here don't care to have
their past history raked over. It ain't always
healthy, son, to ask a man where he came from,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206">206</a></span>
or why he left there. There's secrets, you understand,
that a man don't like strangers to know."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Dick, with a laugh.
"But we only want to see how they get the gold
out of mines."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can see that," was the driver's
answer. "But there's lots of mines nearer than
the Hop Toad and the Dolphin; lots of 'em."</p>

<p>"Aren't those good mines?" asked Dick, anxious
to get the opinion of what might be presumed
to be an unprejudiced observer.</p>

<p>"Well, so folks say," was the cautious answer.
"All mines is good&mdash;until they're found out to be
bad. I guess they're getting gold out of both
mines. Leastways, that's what the men that's
working 'em say."</p>

<p>When the buckboard with its passengers arrived
at the Hop Toad mine the driver called to
a man who seemed to be in charge:</p>

<p>"Say, Nick, here's a crowd of college students
that want to see how you make gold. Any objections?"</p>

<p>The man addressed looked up quickly. Dick
knew at once, from a description the lawyer had
sent to Mr. Hamilton, that the man was Nick
Smith, commonly known as "Forty-niner Smith,"
an old-time miner, who was in charge of the
active operations at the two mines Dick and his
father were interested in. But Dick resolved not
to disclose his own identity unless it became necessary
to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207">207</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, and welcome," responded Forty-niner
Smith, with an assumed heartiness, but
Dick did not like the look on the man's face.
"We're just settin' off a blast," the miner went
on. "Th' tenderfeet kin see a bucket full of gold
in a minute."</p>

<p>The boys joined a group of waiting miners,
who regarded them curiously. All about were
piles of ore and, not far away, were the ruins of
a stamp-mill.</p>

<p>"Our stamp's out of business," said Smith,
noting Dick's glance at it. "We send our ore,
and that from the Dolphin, down to the Wild
Tiger mill. They're crushing it for us. Ah,
boys, there she goes!"</p>

<p>There was a dull rumble from a hole in the
ground, and the earth seemed to tremble. Then
some smoke lazily floated from the mouth of the
mine.</p>

<p>"As soon as it clears away they'll send up
some gold ore," went on Smith, and, in a short
time, a big iron bucket came to the surface on a
strong, wire cable. It was filled with what looked
like pieces of stone, but Smith, taking some of the
fragments, passed them to Dick.</p>

<p>"See that yellow stuff!" he exclaimed, pointing
to numerous shining particles. "That's pure
gold! Here, take some samples along," he added,
in a burst of generosity. "We'll never miss 'em,"
and he filled the hands of the four boys with the
precious metal. "This is one of the richest mines<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208">208</a></span>
in this locality," he added. "Now come on over
and I'll show you the Dolphin," and he led the
way toward the ruins of the stamp-mill.</p>

<p>"Somebody dropped a dynamite cartridge near
it," he explained as he passed it. "But we don't
mind. We've ordered two new ones. I guess
they've got through blasting here. Yes, here
comes some ore," he went on as a bucket of the
stuff that looked like broken cobblestones came
to the surface.</p>

<p>Dick's heart beat fast. At last he was looking
at the mine in which he had invested two thousand
dollars. And, best of all, real gold was being
taken from it. At least it looked like real
gold, and had the same appearance as that from
the Hop Toad mine. Besides, if it was not gold,
why would the men work so hard to get it up?</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm having all my trouble for my
pains," thought Dick. "I guess these mines are
good, after all. Vanderhoof may have been a
swindler, but this looks as if dad and I had made
good investments."</p>

<p>"Here, have some of this ore," added Smith,
with another show of generosity. "We'll never
miss it. Have it made into watch charms or
scarf pins. That's what lots of 'em do."</p>

<p>"Can we go down in the mine?" asked Frank
Bender.</p>

<p>"Not to-day," replied Smith, with a sharp look
at Dick. "You see it's a little dangerous, so soon
after a blast, unless you've had some experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209">209</a></span>
Come out some other day and maybe you can.
Glad to see visitors any time. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'll have to go and see about sending
some of this ore to the stamp-mill. It's so rich
we have to send a guard with it to protect it
from thieves," he added, in a burst of confidence.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we've seen enough," spoke Dick.
"Come on, boys."</p>

<p>As they rode back to the hotel, Dick soon decided
on a plan of action. He would take to a
government assayer the ore he and his companions
had received, and learn whether the mine was or
was not a good one. This time there would be
no chance for deception, he thought. He had
seen, with his own eyes, the ore taken from the
mine. The government assayer, he knew, would
tell the truth about the value of it. Then he
could be satisfied that his investment, as well as
his father's, was a good one.</p>

<p>Explaining his purpose to the boys they readily
gave Dick their samples of ore, though he suggested
they save small pieces for souvenirs, which
they did.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better see the lawyer your father
wrote to," suggested Walter Mead, when they
were almost at the hotel.</p>

<p>"Good idea," declared Dick, but he could not
carry it out, for, on inquiring, he learned that the
lawyer had gone on a journey and would not be
back for a month.</p>

<p>"I'll go ahead on my own responsibility," Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210">210</a></span>
decided. "I think I'll hunt up the government
assayer. I wonder where Tim is?"</p>

<p>The newsboy was not about the hotel, and,
thinking he had gone off to see the sights, Dick
did not look for him. He got the address of the
assayer from the hotel proprietor, and was soon
at the official's office.</p>

<p>"So you want some of this Hop Toad, and
Dolphin ore tested, eh?" inquired the assayer.
"Well, you're not the first person who has brought
me some. I tested some for a man named Hamilton,
away out East, some time ago. His lawyer
brought it to me. I found it good then and I
guess it's good yet."</p>

<p>"Was it really good?" asked Dick, eagerly, and
then, judging the government official could be
trusted, he told the object of his western trip.</p>

<p>"Young man," said the assayer, when Dick had
finished, "I'll tell you all I know. This ore is
good. It's very rich. In fact, I don't need to
assay it to tell that it runs many dollars to the
ton. But one thing I can't tell you to a certainty
is that it came from the Hop Toad or Dolphin
mine. You see we assayers have to take the
word of the miners as to where the ore comes
from. All we do is to make a test, and, by finding
out how much gold there is to a certain
amount of ore, figure out how much it will assay
to a ton of the same ore. That's the basis on
which mines are valued."</p>

<p>"I can assure you that this ore we have came<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211">211</a></span>
from the Dolphin and Hop Toad mines," said
Dick. "We saw it taken out."</p>

<p>"Seeing isn't always believing, when it comes
to mines," replied the assayer. "Still it may have
been taken directly from the drifts. I wouldn't
say it to everyone," he went on, "but I believe
there is something crooked about those mines. I
have thought so for some time, but I can't decide
just what it is. They have a reputation of being
very rich, and the ore assays well, but I don't
like the actions of the men running them."</p>

<p>"Do you think I have been cheated?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"I do, but I can't give my reasons for it."</p>

<p>"Then what would you advise?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're out here to investigate. Keep
on investigating. I'm a government official and
I can't take either side. But if I were you," and
he came close to Dick and spoke in a low tone,
"I'd visit that mine when none of the men were
around. I think they knew you were coming and
prepared for you."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Dick, much surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell you all my reasons now.
Do as I advise, and try to inspect the mines when
no one is around."</p>

<p>"When would be the best time for that?"</p>

<p>"At night. That's the only time it would be
safe. But be very careful. This is a queer country.
Men act quickly out here and they don't always
stop to ask questions before they shoot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212">212</a></span>
But you boys are quick and sharp and&mdash;well,
good luck to you, that's all I can say."</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to you," answered Dick.
"I'll do as you advise."</p>

<p>As he and his chums left the assayer's office
they met Tim, who had returned to the hotel, and,
on inquiring, had learned where they had gone.</p>

<p>"Have a good time?" asked Dick, of his newsboy
friend.</p>

<p>"Not so very," replied Tim, rather solemnly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I was chasin' after a fellow what
called himself Simon Scardale, and I couldn't
catch him."</p>

<p>"Simon Scardale here?" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"That's what he is, and he's on to our game,"
replied Tim. "Dick, youse has got to act quick,
I guess."</p>

<p>For a few moments Dick was too surprised
to know what to say. He began to see through it
now. Simon was a friend of Vanderhoof, and,
though he might not be mixed up in the swindling
games, he had, likely, given information
that would prevent the millionaire's son from accomplishing
his object. Dick was in a maze. He
was not altogether sure that the mines were a
swindle, but he strongly suspected it. Simon's
presence in the western city seemed to argue that
some strange game was about to be played.</p>

<p>"We must talk this over," decided Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213">213</a></span>
"Come on, boys. We'll go back to the hotel and
have a conference. Then we can decide what to
do."</p>

<p>In Dick's room the chums went over all the
points of the matter. But, try as they did, they
could not see a reason for Simon's presence in
Yazoo City, nor for his remarks to Tim.</p>

<p>"But dat government feller give youse good
advice," declared the newsboy. "Why don't
youse go out to de mine? Maybe youse kin git
on to der game. I'm wid youse."</p>

<p>"I believe I will," decided Dick. "Tim, you and
Frank and I will go. Yes, Walter, you and Bricktop
had better stay at the hotel," he added, as he
saw a look of disappointment come over the faces
of the other two boys. "Five would be too many,
and, by some of us staying here, there will be
less liability of suspicion. We'll make a night
trip to the mine and, if it's at all possible, I'll go
down inside."</p>

<p>"Dat's de way to talk!" exclaimed Tim.</p>

<p>Cautiously they made their plans. Dick decided
he and his two companions would walk to
the mines, as, if they hired a rig, it would become
known to Smith or Simon, who were probably
spying on their actions. Tim related how he
had tried to follow Simon when he rode off on
the pony, but had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"It's a nice moonlight night," said Dick, when
the plans had been made. "We can take some
candles with us and I guess we can get down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214">214</a></span>
cable at the mine. Then we'll see if there's any
crooked work going on."</p>

<p>After supper Tim, Frank and Dick started off.
They little realized what was before them, or perhaps
they would not have been so light-hearted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>DOWN IN A GOLD MINE</h3>

<p>"It's going to take over two hours to get out
there," said Dick, as he and his companions
tramped on. "I don't know how long we'll stay.
It all depends on circumstances. If they discover
us we'll not stay as long as we otherwise would,"
and he laughed. "But I guess it's an all-night
job. Well, the road is a good one, and it's a nice
night."</p>

<p>"That's what it is," answered Frank. "That
moon looks as if it was pure silver, hung up there
in the sky."</p>

<p>"You're getting poetical," commented Dick.</p>

<p>"Dat oughter be a gold moon to be right in de
swim," was Tim's opinion.</p>

<p>"What do you expect to do when you get to the
mine?" asked Frank, as, now that they were beyond
the borders of Yazoo City, they were not
afraid to talk of their object.</p>

<p>"I hardly know," answered Dick. "What I
want to find out is whether or not that mine is
a fake one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"How do youse tell a fake gold mine?" asked
Tim. "Is it like a lead nickel or counterfeit money
so youse can tell by bitin' a chunk of it?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," replied Dick, with a laugh. "I've
been reading up about mines lately, and, according
to the book, the most common way of making
a fake mine is to 'salt' it, or 'sweat' it."</p>

<p>"Salt it?" repeated Frank. "I've heard of salting
cattle, but never mines."</p>

<p>"That doesn't describe it very well," went on
Dick, "but that's what they call it. Sometimes it
is termed 'sweating.' By either way it means
making the ore in the mine look as if it was filled
with gold, when, in fact, the gold had only been
put there by some man who wanted a worthless
mine to look like a good one."</p>

<p>"How do they do it?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"The most common way is to take some real
gold dust, put it into a shotgun, load it heavily
with powder and shoot it at the side of the mine.
The gold particles are shot into the rock a little
way and it appears like real ore. They do this
several times down the sides of a rocky mine and
it looks very much like the real thing. After a
man has bought the mine and begins to dig, he
discovers it's all a fake."</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Tim. "T'ink of shootin'
gold out of a gun. I wish somebody'd take a few
shots at me. Easy ones, of course, so's I could
live to enjoy it."</p>

<p>"There are other ways of making fake mines,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217">217</a></span>
went on Dick, "but I didn't read much about
them."</p>

<p>"Do you think the Hop Toad and Dolphin
mines are fakes?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm afraid of. But I'm pretty
sure Smith and his confederates didn't use any
such method as shooting the gold into the rocks.
It's in too deep for that, and they could hardly
hope to fool the assayer that way. No, they must
have some new scheme, and maybe I can discover
it."</p>

<p>The boys walked along briskly, and, almost before
they realized it, they saw that they were approaching
the mine.</p>

<p>"Now, go easy," advised Dick. "We first want
to see if there is anyone in sight. If not, we'll
take a trip down."</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the shaft was some machinery
used to lift the bucket from the mine.
The boys could see the dull gleam of the coals
under the boiler of the hoisting apparatus, for
the fire had been banked. But there was no sign
of anyone around, and, after peering cautiously
about, the boys reached the edge of the shaft.</p>

<p>"Now, if dey had an elevator fer us it would
be dead easy," spoke Tim. "But I don't see how
youse is goin' to git down."</p>

<p>"Wait until I take a look," replied Dick.</p>

<p>He approached the mouth of the mine and uttered
an exclamation that brought the other boys
to his side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a ladder leading down," he said. "We
can use that. Now to explore a gold mine."</p>

<p>Seeing that he had his candles and matches
ready, Dick began to descend. The other boys
waited until he was down some distance and then
followed. The ladder, as they could see, was
built against the side of the shaft, and it was
far enough away so that the ascending or descending
bucket did not touch it.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Dick, from the dark depths.
"I'm going to light a candle."</p>

<p>Presently a faint gleam came up the shaft, and
Tim and Frank could make out Dick's form
standing below them on a rung of the ladder.
They also lighted candles, and the descent continued.
In about a minute Dick called again:</p>

<p>"Easy now, fellows; I've struck bottom. Got
down to the first level, I guess."</p>

<p>In a little while Tim and Frank joined him.
They found they were standing in a sort of cave,
hollowed out under ground. Resting at the foot
of the shaft was a big bucket, attached to the
wire cable that extended to the hoisting drum.</p>

<p>"Is dis all dere is to de mine?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"No, there seems to be a gallery leading off
to no one knows where," replied Dick, pointing
to a gloomy hole. "Come on, boys, I haven't seen
any gold yet," and he waved his candle to and
fro. It flickered over the rocky walls of the
mine. They glistened with water that oozed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219">219</a></span>
many crevices, but there was no glitter of the
precious metal.</p>

<p>The boys walked cautiously along the gallery,
or tunnel, that extended at right angles to the
perpendicular shaft. Suddenly, Dick, who was
in the lead, stopped short.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he exclaimed, in a whisper. "I hear
voices."</p>

<p>The boys listened. From somewhere in the
darkness ahead of them came an indistinct murmur.</p>

<p>"Come ahead, easy!" whispered the millionaire's
son.</p>

<p>They advanced on tiptoes. The murmur of
voices became louder. Then, as the boys made
a turn in the tunnel, a strange scene was suddenly
presented to them.</p>

<p>In a sort of cave, formed by the widening of
the gallery, a number of men stood in a group.
Several torches, stuck into cracks in the rocky
wall, gave light. But, strangest of all, was the
occupation of the men.</p>

<p>One of them was stirring what seemed like a
mass of mortar in a wooden box, such as masons
use. Into it another was pouring from a sack,
gleaming, golden, yellow particles, which, as the
light gleamed on them, glittered like gold.</p>

<p>"Seems like throwing the yellow stuff away,"
remarked the man who held the sack.</p>

<p>"What of it. We'll get it back five times over,"
replied the one who, with a hoe, was stirring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220">220</a></span>
stuff. "It's like planting gold in a garden. It
grows, you know. This mine is our garden."</p>

<p>"They're 'salting' the mine," whispered Dick to
his companions.</p>

<p>Off to one side another man was drilling holes
in the soft rock. The musical clink of his hammer
on the drill sounded faint and far off, so
muffled was it.</p>

<p>"Haven't you got that stuff ready yet?" called
the man with the drill. "I've got all the holes
bored. Hurry up and get it in or it won't be hard
by to-morrow, and there's no telling when that
Hamilton kid may take a notion to drop in and
visit his mine," and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I can keep him away for a few
days yet," answered one, whom Dick recognized
as Forty-niner Smith. "I've got a game I haven't
played. But I guess this stuff is mixed enough.
Say, it's the best scheme I've struck yet for 'sweating'
a mine. Beats the shotguns all to pieces."</p>

<p>From their hiding place the boys watched what
the men did. The mixture with the gold particles
in it was poured into the holes the man had dug.
The boys could see now that it was not mortar,
but concrete, which was being used. To Dick the
whole scheme was now plain.</p>

<p>The men poured a lot of gold dust into some
concrete, and mixed it up with water until it was
about as thick as paste. Then they put it into
holes drilled in the rocky walls of the mine. The
concrete hardened and became almost like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221">221</a></span>
rock itself. Then, when a blast was set off, the
rock, concrete and gold was all blown into small
pieces, so that it looked as if the ore was of good,
gold-bearing quality, whereas it was nothing but
ordinary rock "salted."</p>

<p>That was how the men were working to fool
investors. They had taken an abandoned mine,
from which all the gold had been dug, and, by
this ingenious method, made it look, to the ignorant,
as though it was a regular bonanza.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Dick, in a whisper, "we've
discovered the trick. I guess dad's money and
mine, too, is 'gone up the flume,' as the miners
say. But I'm glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, Frank, who was balancing
himself on a bit of rock, in order to see better,
stumbled and fell, making quite a noise. The men
turned as if a shot had been fired.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Smith, in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>"Some loose rock caving in," answered one of
the men. "Come on, finish up. We've only got
one more hole to fill, and by that time Nash will
be ready to hoist us up."</p>

<p>"That wasn't falling rock!" declared Smith.
"Boys, I believe someone is spying on us. I'm
going to take a look."</p>

<p>Seizing one of the torches he started toward
where Dick and his companions were hiding.</p>

<p>"Come on!" exclaimed the millionaire's son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222">222</a></span>
pulling Tim and Frank by the arm. "We've got
to get out of this!"</p>

<p>They turned and ran, their footsteps echoing
on the rocky floor of the mine. They could hear
Smith coming after them. His torch flashed
around the turn in the gallery. He caught sight
of them.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried. "Stop or I'll shoot!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223">223</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>SIMON'S CONFESSION</h3>

<p>Dick gave a hurried look behind him. He
could see something shining in Smith's hand&mdash;something
that the light from the torch glinted on.</p>

<p>"Keep on!" hoarsely whispered Tim. "He
can't hit us down here. Keep on!"</p>

<p>Stumbling, almost falling, their candles showing
but faint blue points of light as the flame
flickered away from the wicks because of their
speed, the boys ran toward the bottom of the
shaft.</p>

<p>"If we reach the ladder I think we can get
away," said Frank, panting from his exertion.</p>

<p>It seemed as if it was a mile back to the shaft,
but it was only a few hundred feet. The boys
expected every minute to hear the shot ring out.
They caught the sounds of the footfalls of their
pursuer and they sounded nearer and nearer. He
was familiar with the gallery and his torch gave
him better light to go by than did the candles
give the boys.</p>

<p>Once more the angry miner's voice called:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on, whoever you are, or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>"Quick! There's the shaft!" exclaimed Dick,
pointing to where the big bucket rested at the
bottom of the opening.</p>

<p>The boys made a rush for it. At the same instant
a shot rang out in the darkness, the flash
from the revolver lighting up the mine cavern
with sudden glare. They could hear the bullet
strike far above their heads with a vicious "ping!"
Clearly, Smith was only firing to scare them, and
did not want to run any chances of hurting them,
as he had aimed high.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. The cable,
attached to the bucket, began to wind upward.
There was considerable slack to it and the bucket
did not immediately follow. It was evident that
the machinery at the shaft mouth had started
and that the ore-carrier was about to be hoisted
up. An inspiration came to Dick.</p>

<p>"Into the bucket!" he called. "It's big enough
to hold us all and we'll be hauled to the top! We
can escape that way!"</p>

<p>Tim and Frank needed no further urging.
They clambered over the iron sides of the bucket,
followed by Dick. And not a second too soon,
for, as he set his feet on the iron bottom, the
cable tauted and the bucket started upward.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" yelled Smith, reaching the
bottom of the shaft just in time to see the conveyor
disappearing. He made an ineffectual grab
for it, but, as his torch flared up when he threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225">225</a></span>
it on the ground, the better to use his hands,
Dick, looking over the edge of the iron receptacle,
saw that the ugly miner was fifteen feet below
them.</p>

<p>"Pull your head in!" advised Frank. "He
might shoot!"</p>

<p>But Smith had no such intentions. Making a
sort of megaphone of his hands, he shouted up
the shaft:</p>

<p>"Nash! Nash! Stop the engine! Don't hoist
the bucket! We're not in it!"</p>

<p>But the engineer at the mouth of the shaft
never heard him. Higher and higher went the
bucket, carrying the boys. They looked up the
black opening and could see the moon shining
overhead.</p>

<p>"Lucky escape!" murmured Dick. "I wonder
how that bucket came to go up just when we
needed it most?"</p>

<p>He learned a minute later. As the conveyor
reached the surface and stopped, Dick and his
friends stepped out. They saw that the fire under
the boiler was burning brightly, and that a
man, who had not been there when they arrived,
was attending to the hoisting engine. As he
caught sight of them he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where's Smith?"</p>

<p>"Down there," replied Dick, not caring to go
into details. "Come on, boys."</p>

<p>"But something's wrong," went on Nash, the
engineer. "I was told to come here about one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226">226</a></span>
o'clock, get up steam and be ready to hoist the
bucket when I heard a revolver shot. I heard it
and I hoisted away. But where's Smith and his
men? He told me he'd fire a shot when he was
ready to come up. I heard it plain enough, but
who are you?"</p>

<p>"Smith will explain," replied Dick. "We came
up first, that's all," he added, coolly. "Come on,
boys."</p>

<p>Leaving behind them a much-puzzled engineer,
the three boys hurried away from the mine. They
were soon on the road leading back to Yazoo City.</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll chase us?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"I don't believe so," replied Dick. "I guess
Smith is worried enough as it is. He may suspect
who we were, but I don't believe he knows
for certain. However, we'll keep in the shadows
for a way."</p>

<p>This they did, but there was no need of apprehension,
for none of the miners pursued them.</p>

<p>"Well, youse had your money's worth of excitement,
anyway," commented Tim. "Say, I
t'ought it was all up wid me dere, one spell. But
youse had your nerve wid you, Mr. Dick."</p>

<p>"Well, we had some luck with us, too," replied
the millionaire's son. "Those fellows played
right into our hands. They must have gone down
the mine early in the evening, and arranged with
the engineer to come back, when they were finished
with their 'salting' process, to hoist up their
tools and things so as to leave nothing suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227">227</a></span>
around. When Smith fired at us the engineer,
who arrived after we had gone down the mine,
thought it was the signal agreed upon and he
hoisted away. I guess he was surprised when
he saw us get out of the bucket."</p>

<p>"And I guess Smith will be surprised when he
finds out you know how he and his gang fixed up
the fake mine," remarked Frank.</p>

<p>"I guess the best plan will be to say nothing
to him about it," said Dick. "I don't see anything
for me to do but go back home and report
to dad. We've been swindled, and I'm out two
thousand dollars. I don't know how much he
lost. The Hop Toad and Dolphin mines aren't
worth anything, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Did youse lose two t'ousand dollars?" asked
Tim, as the boys hurried along the moonlit road.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"An' youse ain't agoin' to faint over it? Say,
youse has got nerve, youse has," added the newsboy,
admiringly. "Youse oughter be in N' York.
How'd you come to put so much money in a fake
mine?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was a fake," replied the
wealthy youth.</p>

<p>The boys reached their hotel in the gray dawn
of the early morning. They were worn out and
tired from their long tramp and the excitement
of the night. As they entered the lobby, where
a sleepy clerk was on duty behind the desk, the
latter called to them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228">228</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, is one of you named Dick Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got a message for you from a lad
named Simon Scardale."</p>

<p>"Simon Scardale?" repeated Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes. He was badly hurt last night by a fall
from a horse he was riding. He's over at the
other hotel, and he sent word that he wanted to
see Dick Hamilton as soon as he came in. I
looked over the register, but I couldn't see anyone
by that name, and I thought he'd made a
mistake."</p>

<p>Dick recalled his scrawling signature on the
book, and did not wonder that the clerk could not
make it out.</p>

<p>Telling Tim and Frank to go upstairs and notify
Bricktop and Walter of their safe arrival,
Dick started for the Imperial Inn. He found the
night clerk on duty, and, telling his object, was
shown upstairs by a sleepy bell-boy.</p>

<p>As he entered the room he saw Simon in bed.
The youth's face was pale, and his head was covered
with bandages. Two doctors were within
call.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Dick Hamilton?" he asked in a
weak voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you want, Simon?" inquired
Dick, softly, for the sight of Simon's sufferings
banished all resentment.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm badly hurt," went on Simon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229">229</a></span>
"and I want to tell you something before&mdash;before
I go away from here. Come closer."</p>

<p>"Now don't excite yourself," advised one of the
doctors.</p>

<p>"I won't, but I must tell Dick," went on Simon.
"I'm sorry I put up that game to steal Grit," he
said, almost in a whisper. "But I needed money
very much and I didn't see any other way to get
it. Guy didn't have anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"I know," said Dick, softly.</p>

<p>"I played another mean trick on you," went on
the injured youth. "I've been spying on you for
Vanderhoof. After I got Grit and you saw me
that day at the hotel, I was afraid. I knew
Vanderhoof, or Colonel Dendon, as he sometimes
calls himself, and I went to him. He said he
could give me a job out West and he sent me
here. Then, I guess it must have been the day
you started, he telegraphed me to be on the lookout
for you, and to inform Forty-niner Smith
when you arrived. I did."</p>

<p>"Were you in the game to help work off a
worthless mine on me?" asked Dick, a little resentfully.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Simon, earnestly. "I only
learned of that by accident. When I found out
the mines were no good I was going to have nothing
more to do with any of the gang. But Smith
told me your father had once got the best of
Vanderhoof in a business deal and that this was
the only way they could get their money back&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230">230</a></span>
sell him a worthless mine. They said it was
done every day and&mdash;and I believed them. I
only kept them informed of your movements so
they could fix things up to&mdash;to deceive you, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Dick.</p>

<p>"But I'm done with 'em now," went on Simon.
"I was riding out to the mine to-night, after I
saw you three start for it. Oh, I kept close watch
on you," he said in answer to Dick's look of surprise.
"I started for the mine to warn them you
were coming, as I knew they were going to do
some 'salting.' My horse threw me before I'd
gone far and&mdash;well, I'm pretty badly hurt, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Now that will do," interrupted one of the
physicians. "You can tell the rest another time.
You must be quiet now."</p>

<p>"There isn't any more to tell," said Simon, in a
whisper. "That's all, Dick, but I feel better for
having told you."</p>

<p>"Well, Simon," said the millionaire's son, "I'm
sorry you are hurt. I forgive you. I guess you
didn't realize what you were doing."</p>

<p>"That's it. I never realized what bad men Vanderhoof,
Smith and the others were. I'm done
with them forever. I guess I can go to sleep
now."</p>

<p>He turned over and closed his eyes. Dick softly
left the room, followed by one of the doctors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he badly hurt?" he asked of the medical
man, when they were out in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Well, he is hurt internally. I think we can
pull him through with careful nursing. Is he a
friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"I used to think he was," answered Dick. "I
guess he got into bad company, that's the trouble.
I'd like to help him if I could. Here, doctor, take
this and see that he has good nursing, will you,
please," and Dick thrust a hundred-dollar bill
into the physician's hand.</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this is quite a sum of money."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess dad would want me to spend
it," replied Dick. "I've got lots more. Anyhow,
I couldn't bear to think of Simon suffering, even
if he did do me some mean turns. Will you look
after him, doctor? I've got to go back East."</p>

<p>"I will, young man, and he can thank you for
befriending him. I guess those men won't have
anything more to do with him after this, and it's
hard for a lad like him to be sick in a wild country
like this. I'll see that he has the best of care."</p>

<p>Pondering over the strange events of the last
few hours, Dick went back to his hotel. It was
now nearly breakfast-time and he was ready for
the meal, especially the hot coffee. Tim and
Frank, also, did full justice to it, and then, being
very sleepy, they went to bed, as did Dick.</p>

<p>"We'll start back home to-morrow," the millionaire's
son said to his chums as he went to his
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE PANIC</h3>

<p>Although a little apprehensive that Smith and
his gang might make trouble for him, Dick
leisurely made his preparations for going back
East, when, late in the afternoon, after a long
slumber, he awoke much refreshed. But the
miner and his men did not appear in Yazoo City.
Dick called on the government assayer and told
him what he and his chums had seen.</p>

<p>"That's a new way of 'salting' a mine," the
official said. "A very good one, too, from a
swindler's standpoint. Now, if you want to, you
can make a complaint against those men and have
them arrested."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it wouldn't make the mines any
good, or save the money dad and I put into them,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe it would. Besides, they
are a slick crowd, I suppose, and you'd have trouble
convicting them. Perhaps it is better to let
it drop. I'll be on the watch, however, and if I
hear of anyone about to invest in the stock of any
mines Smith and his men are interested in I'll
warn him."</p>

<p>Dick called to say good-bye to Simon. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233">233</a></span>
found the bad boy a little improved, and when
informed that he would be well taken care of the
tears came into the eyes of the youth who had
done so much to injure Dick.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you're a brick!" he stammered. "I
don't deserve it, but if&mdash;if I ever get well maybe
I can do something for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," replied Dick, somewhat
affected by Simon's misery. "You'll soon be as
well as ever, and when you do get around again,
you'd better steer clear of such men as Colonel
Dendon."</p>

<p>"I will," promised Simon, and he tried to return
the pressure of Dick's hand, but it was hard
work, for he was very weak.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Dick and his friends
started for home. Dick was a little thoughtful,
and Frank asked:</p>

<p>"Worrying about your lost money, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Well, not so much about the money as I am
over the consequences. I counted on this mine
investment being a good one. But, I have another.
I guess my stock in the milk concern will
pan out pretty well."</p>

<p>"If it don't youse had better come to N' York
wid me, an' sell papes," advised Tim.</p>

<p>"I'll think of it," promised Dick, with a smile.</p>

<p>The ride back home was uneventful. Tim decided
he would not go back to Hamilton Corners,
as he was anxious to get to New York.</p>

<p>"Got to look after me paper business," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234">234</a></span>
with a laugh. "I left me pardner in charge an'
he's a little chap. Some of de big guys might
drive him offen de swell corner we has. It's de
best corner in N' York fer doin' business," he explained.
"I stands in wid de cop on de beat an'
he sees I ain't bothered. But I'm gittin' worried.
I see some of de yellow journals is predictin' bad
times an' I wants to be prepared for 'em. Besides,
I've got some customers what owe me&mdash;one
man run up a bill of a quarter jest 'fore I
went on dat fresh-air racket, an' I want to collect
it. So I t'ink I'll git back to little old N' York."</p>

<p>The boys parted from Tim with regret, for
they liked his sterling character, which shone out
through a coat of rough manners. He changed
at a junction point for a train that went direct
to the big city, and gaily waved his hand to them
as it departed. He had profited much by coming
to Hamilton Corners, for Dick had fitted him up
with some good clothes, and, at parting, had
slipped a bank bill into his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was glad to see his son back,
and listened with interest to the account of the
western trip.</p>

<p>"And so our money is gone," finished Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no use crying over spilled milk,
as the farmer's wife used to say," remarked the
millionaire, with a calmness that Dick could not
help envying. "It isn't the first time I've lost
money by unwise speculation, but it's all in the
game. I'm sorry for you, though, Dick."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry for myself. It looks as if I had a
poor head for business."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll learn," consoled his father. "It
takes time."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's Uncle Ezra waiting for me,"
went on Dick, as though he could see the harsh
old man outside in a carriage, waiting to carry
him off to the gloomy Firs. "When he hears of
this he'll think sure I'm doomed to go and board
with him."</p>

<p>"The year is quite a way from being completed,"
said Mr. Hamilton. "Lots of things may
happen before your next birthday."</p>

<p>"I hope they do," said Dick, rather ruefully.
"Anyway, I have my milk stock. They didn't
send for another assessment while I was away,
did they?"</p>

<p>"No, and I see the stock has advanced in value
a point or two."</p>

<p>"Then I may be all right, after all. But I think
I'll be on the lookout for another investment, and
it's not going to be a gold mine, either," finished
Dick.</p>

<p>It was about a week after this that, coming
down to breakfast one morning, Dick was met
by the butler.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman waiting to see you, Master
Dick," said the servant.</p>

<p>"To see me, Gibbs? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he came very early and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236">236</a></span>
says he has something to show you. He says
he wants you to help him with it."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's another of those reporters," said
Dick. "I will see him right after breakfast."</p>

<p>"I'd rather you see me now," interrupted a
voice, and to Dick's astonishment there walked
into the dining-room, from the library where he
had been waiting, a little man, whose hair seemed
to stick out at every point of the compass. His
clothes were rather ragged, and, as he advanced,
he kept running his hands through his hair. To
do this he had to transfer, first from one arm
to the other, a large box he carried.</p>

<p>"I'll not take much of your time," said the little
man. "All I want is your assistance in having
a lot of these machines made. You see how this
one works," and, stooping over, he placed the
box on the floor. From it came a clicking sound,
as the little man, with his head tilted to one side,
waited with watch in hand.</p>

<p>"It will go off in three minutes," he said.</p>

<p>Following the startling announcement of the
little man Dick and Gibbs, the butler, seemed
paralyzed. The room was so still that the ticking
of the machine on the floor sounded like an
immense alarm clock. Then, as the seconds
passed and the stranger stood calmly looking
alternately at Dick, Gibbs, and the box, the butler,
with a sudden start back to life, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Jump out of the window, Master Dick! I'll
attend to this lunatic!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not a lunatic!" shouted the little man.
"I'm Professor Messapatomia!"</p>

<p>"Jump!" shouted Gibbs to Dick. "It isn't far
to the ground. This thing will go off in a minute!"</p>

<p>"Half a minute," calmly corrected the stranger,
as he snapped his watch shut. At that instant
Mary, the waitress, came into the room with a
large pitcher of water. As Dick turned to flee,
for he realized that he might be courting death
to remain, should the lunatic's infernal apparatus
go off, Gibbs grabbed the pitcher.</p>

<p>"I'll fix it!" the butler cried, throwing the
water at the ticking machine. "But jump, all the
same, Master Dick!"</p>

<p>As Dick prepared to jump from one of the
dining-room windows, believing that, as he had
often read of such things occurring, he was
to be made the victim of a crank, the machine
gave a louder click. Professor Messapatomia,
with a sudden motion of his arm, diverted the
aim of Gibbs, and the water flew to one side
of the box. At the same moment there was a
jar, as from a heavy spring, and a shower of
white objects scattered about the room.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the professor, triumphantly,
"that's how it works! Very simple, you see,
and it scatters the bait all around. Then all you
have to do is to take your pole and line and catch
all the fish you want."</p>

<p>"Fish!" repeated Dick, somewhat in a daze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238">238</a></span>
He had expected the house to be half-blown apart,
yet the machine only scattered harmless pieces
of paper about.</p>

<p>"Fish, of course," replied the professor,
"What did you think this was?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you an Anarchist, and isn't that an infernal
machine?" demanded Gibbs, wiping away
some of the water he had accidentally spilled
over his head when the professor knocked up his
arm.</p>

<p>"Anarchist? Infernal machine?" repeated
Professor Messapatomia. "Why, my dear sir,
that is my latest invention of a fish-catching device.
You see, you wind up the spring, and you
set it to go off at any hour you wish. Then you
put some finely chopped pieces of meat in this
top pan. That is the bait. Only in this case, as
I didn't want to muss up the room, I used bits
of paper. At the proper time the machine, which
you have set beside the stream where you desire
to fish, goes off. The bait is thrown all over the
surface of the water. It attracts the fish, and
when you throw in your line you have no end of
bites. It's the greatest idea of the age! It will
revolutionize fishing! It's simply marvelous!</p>

<p>"I have just perfected the invention, but I need
money to put the machine on the market. You,
sir," turning to Dick, "are just the person to help
me. I read of your immense wealth and that you
are fond of all sports. Fishing is a sport, therefore
I came to you. All I need is ten thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239">239</a></span>
dollars and it will make both of us rich in a year.
Now, if you will kindly write me out a check for
that amount, I'll bid you good-morning, and you
can go on with your breakfast which I have interrupted."</p>

<p>He began to pick up the scattered bits of paper,
Mary helping him, while Gibbs gazed rather
stupidly at the queer figure with the bristling hair.
Then Dick laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly gave me a scare," he said.
"I thought you wanted to blow the place up.
But I'm sorry I can't invest ten thousand dollars
in that machine. It seems to me it would be just
as easy to stand on the shore and throw the pieces
of meat in the water by hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, you could do it that way,"
admitted the professor, "but it isn't half so scientific.
However, I'll not urge you," and, picking
up his apparatus, he left the room after a low
bow to Dick.</p>

<p>"He went away with less trouble than I expected,"
remarked Dick, as he looked at the wet
place on the floor and at some of the bits of
paper that still remained. "Well, Gibbs, I admit
I was scared for a minute."</p>

<p>"So was I, Master Dick. I shouldn't have let
him in, only you had given orders that all respectable-looking
visitors were to be treated nicely,
and I'm sure he looked respectable in spite of
his queer hair."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he was respectable, all right. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240">240</a></span>
not your fault, Gibbs. I guess I'll have to draw
the line about callers a little closer," concluded
Dick as he sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>The summer passed away and fall came. Dick
returned to the academy, where he renewed his
studies. Several times he was on the point of
making another investment, but, as the stock of
the milk company went up in value, he felt that
this would answer the requirements of his mother's
will, and furnish the profit called for. So,
though he investigated many schemes that seemed
to promise well, he did not take any stock in them.</p>

<p>It was in May of the following spring, when,
having looked at a quotation of his milk stock,
and found that it was a little higher than it had
ever been before, Dick walked down to his
father's bank to consult him about certain matters.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Hamilton in his private office,
but the millionaire did not have a cheerful smile
on his face. Instead he looked troubled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, dad?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like the way the money market
looks in New York," was the answer. "I've just
heard by telegraph that several large banks have
failed."</p>

<p>"Does it involve you?"</p>

<p>"To a certain extent, yes. Things look like a
panic, such as we had a few years ago. Still, it
may blow over."</p>

<p>"I wonder if it will affect the milk company?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"It might. But there, Dick, don't go to worrying.
You'll have enough of that to do when you
get older. Things may turn out all right." But
the worried look did not leave Mr. Hamilton's
face, in spite of his attempt to cheer up his son.</p>

<p>The next morning when Dick came down to
breakfast he saw his father at the table. But,
instead of eating, the millionaire was eagerly
looking at a newspaper. Dick glanced over his
father's shoulder. There, staring at him, in big
black letters, was the heading of a long article:</p>

<h3>GREAT MONEY PANIC!</h3>

<p>"Are things&mdash;are things in bad shape, dad?"
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Pretty much so," replied Mr. Hamilton, not
looking up. "It's not as bad as I feared, though,
and our bank will not suffer. However, lots of
small concerns, and some big ones, have failed."</p>

<p>Then Dick caught sight of another part of the
paper. He could hardly believe his eyes, for, in
a prominent part of the page, was an article telling
of the failure of the big milk concern in which
he had invested.</p>

<p>"Dad!" he exclaimed, taking hold of the paper,
and pointing to the account.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Hamilton. "I saw it. Your
investment is a failure, Dick."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242">242</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>HENRY IN TROUBLE</h3>

<p>For a few moments father and son looked at
each other. Dick hardly knew what to say, but
the millionaire was evidently used to harder business
disappointments than the present one, for he
laughed and remarked:</p>

<p>"Never mind, Dick. You made a good attempt,
but you failed. You have over a month yet in
which to comply with the terms of the will. In
that time you ought to be able to find some good,
paying investment. Look over the paper. There's
lots of bad financial news in it, but you may find
some good. I must hurry to the bank. This
panic will affect a number of our customers. I'm
going to be very busy for some days to come."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton continued with his breakfast as
if nothing had happened, but poor Dick's appetite
vanished. He had counted so much on his
shares in the milk company paying well that he
had never thought of failure. Particularly as,
of late, they had seemingly increased in value.
But, as he learned by looking over the paper after
his father left, many older and stronger concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243">243</a></span>
than the milk company in which he was interested
had failed.</p>

<p>"Panics are bad things," murmured Dick,
which sentiment was echoed by many another
person that day.</p>

<p>Still Dick was not too much cast down. He
knew he was a very wealthy young man, and he
had no fear that his father's millions would be
disturbed in the general hard times that would be
sure to follow. But it hurt his pride that, with
all his wealth, he could not do as much as little
Tim Muldoon had done&mdash;start with nothing and
make money.</p>

<p>"I'm almost ready to sell papers," mused Dick,
with a smile.</p>

<p>However, he decided to do nothing rash. He
still had more than a month until his birthday&mdash;the
time limit for making the paying investment&mdash;and
he felt that in that period something would
occur that would enable him to fulfil the conditions
of his mother's will.</p>

<p>"At any rate, I've got to go to school to-day,"
he said to himself, as he finished what, for him,
was rather a slim breakfast. "I guess I'll come
out right in the end. In fact, I've got to if I
want to escape Uncle Ezra's clutches."</p>

<p>As Dick was coming home from his classes
that afternoon, turning over in his mind various
plans for making a good investment&mdash;from growing
mushrooms or raising squabs to starting a
brass band or becoming proprietor of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244">244</a></span>
circus&mdash;he saw coming toward him a dilapidated
rig. He knew it could be none other than that of
Henry Darby. As the horse and wagon approached
it seemed to Dick to look, more than
ever, ready to fall apart.</p>

<p>"Well, Henry," he remarked. "I see you're
still in business. The panic hasn't bothered you,
has it?"</p>

<p>"Not me, so much as it has the horse and
wagon," replied Henry, with a laugh. "Don't
you think that beast's ribs are nearer caving in
than they were the last time you saw it?"</p>

<p>"He does look thinner, for a fact," admitted
Dick.</p>

<p>"He is," and Henry spoke with solemn earnestness.
"They were almost touching on either side
this morning, but I gave him all the hay I could
afford and that sort of spread them apart. As
for the wagon&mdash;well, I don't need any bell or
automobile horn to tell people I'm coming. It
rattles enough to be heard two blocks off."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get a better outfit?" suggested
Dick. "I should think it would pay."</p>

<p>"It might pay, but I couldn't. I'll have to get
along with this for a while," and Henry looked
at the odd assortment of old metal he had collected
and was taking to his storage yard.</p>

<p>"Isn't the business paying as well as you
thought it would, Henry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the business is all right. The trouble is
the way the president manages it," and Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245">245</a></span>
smiled ruefully. "You remember I told you dad
had taken most of the surplus capital for one of
his schemes," and he looked inquiringly at Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember, you said he thought there
were thousands of dollars in it."</p>

<p>"Well, they're still there," said Henry, with
dry humor. "Dad hasn't been able to induce 'em
to come forth and nestle in his or my pockets.
That's why I haven't enough money to buy a new
horse and wagon. If I had it I could cover more
ground in a day and do more business. As for
this&mdash;this&mdash;well, I don't know what to call him.
He reminds me of a heap of old iron, sticking out
seven ways from Sunday, as the old saying is.
You see his bones stick out like so many points."</p>

<p>"They do, for a fact," and Dick looked at the
horse, that presented more angles than he had
ever before imagined a horse possessed.</p>

<p>"There's one consolation," went on Henry.
"He's cheap, but there's another disadvantage,
he looks it. So does the wagon. Whenever I
start away from home to collect old metal I always
tell dad not to worry if I don't get back that
night. There's no telling which will break down
first&mdash;the horse or the wagon. It's like taking a
voyage in a sailing ship, no telling when you'll
arrive.</p>

<p>"Still," he went on, "there's one advantage.
It keeps my journeys from being monotonous.
Nothing like having a horse that may develop
spavin, ring bone or heaves on the road any min<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246">246</a></span>ute,
or a wagon that may drop all four wheels at
once and break every spring. It keeps me from
getting lonesome."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear the old metal business is so
poor," remarked Dick. "What caused the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, dad got an idea that he knew a lot about
old iron and such things. He started in to do
the buying and I was to go after the stuff, when
he had purchased it, and bring it home. He did
buy some iron scrap and a lot of old horseshoes
that I made a profit on. Then he heard of some
metal at an old factory. Someone told him it
had a lot of platinum in it. Now, platinum is
very valuable. Dad thought he had struck a bargain.
He paid a big price for the stuff. In fact,
he used up every cent I had put away in order
to get hold of that metal he thought had platinum
in it."</p>

<p>"Didn't it?" asked Dick, as Henry stopped.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Someone worked off a lot of steel
and iron mixed, on poor old dad. I can't sell it
anywhere. It's a peculiar mixture of metal.
Some new company had it made for their machinery
and they busted up. I've got the stuff
back in the storage yard now. Can't get rid of it,
though I've tried all over. That's where all my
money is. So I have to begin all over again."</p>

<p>"It's too bad," said Dick, with ready sympathy.</p>

<p>"Yes, dad felt quite cut-up over it&mdash;for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247">247</a></span>
days. Then he thought of a new scheme. He
says it'll make our fortune if he can only work it.
But he hasn't any capital to start it, and, until I
work some up in a small way, I haven't any,
either. But there, I'm sorry I bothered you with
all my troubles. I guess you have enough of
your own. I'll pull out somehow." And calling
to the horse, that had gone to sleep, Henry managed
to arouse the animal and started off, the
wagon rattling like a load of steel girders.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be going wrong," murmured
Dick, as he walked toward home. "I
guess I'll have to help Henry along some more.
He deserves it. And I must do something about
my own investment. The time is getting shorter."</p>

<p>For two weeks Dick thought over many plans,
but as fast as he made them he rejected them.
Some his father advised him against, and others,
after consideration, he decided would not give
an adequate return for money invested. He was
getting worried, for it was only a little more than
a month until his birthday, when, if he had not
complied with the provisions of the will, he must
spend a year with his Uncle Ezra. The thought
of that made him gloomy indeed.</p>

<p>He had almost decided, one afternoon, to put
some money in a small ice-cream store, which he
heard was being started at Lake Dunkirk for the
summer excursion season.</p>

<p>"There ought to be good money in that," reasoned
Dick. "I could get a lot of my friends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248">248</a></span>
buy ice-cream there and it would help me to make
a profit. I think I'll look up the manager and
see if he'll take a partner."</p>

<p>He was about to go out, to put his newly-formed
resolution into operation, when the maid
announced a gentleman to see him.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"He won't tell me his name. He insists on
seeing you at once."</p>

<p>"Another crank, I suppose. I thought they
were done coming here. Well, show him in."</p>

<p>A moment later there entered the room a little
man, with a long white beard and snow-white
hair. He had the jolliest face imaginable, and
looked just like a picture of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce myself," he said, with
a German accent. "I am Herr Wilhelm Doodlebrod,
und I haf de airship at der freight station.
When can I gif you an exhibition?"</p>

<p>"Airship?" murmured Dick, in bewilderment,
While Herr Doodlebrod nodded several times and
chuckled, as if it was the best joke in the world.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249">249</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>THE FLYING MACHINE.</h3>

<p>Dick looked closely at Herr Doodlebrod, as if
to see if the German had a bomb concealed about
him, for the millionaire's son believed the man
was another of the unfortunate persons who had
some impossible scheme he wanted aid in perfecting.</p>

<p>"You vill like der airship, yes?" went on the
smiling, little, old man. "Ah, he is a beautiful
airship!&mdash;so strong, so graceful, und he sails
along so just like a bird!"</p>

<p>Again he smiled, and then he laughed, as
though he had just told Dick a very funny story.
The German's good nature was catching, and
Dick also smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite understand you," the
boy said.</p>

<p>"Ach! Dot is easy!" replied Herr Doodlebrod.
"See, listen, it is dis vay. I am de greatest inventor
of an airships vot efer vas," and he said
it as if he meant it, with child-like directness, "I
haf der ship vot all der scientists haf long been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250">250</a></span>
vaiting for. I haf bring him to your town und I
show you how he vorks."</p>

<p>"But why did you bring it to me?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Vhy? Because, listen," and the little man
approached closer and began whispering. "I
read about you in der papers. Iss it nod so?"
and he smiled broadly. "You are der richest
young man vot efer vos. Ach, I know!" and
he winked one eye at Dick, as though the millionaire's
son had tried to conceal something.</p>

<p>"So, now I proceed. I hear of your great
wealth. I learn you vos a young mans. You are
bright, quick, smart. Yes, iss it not? Vell, I
invent der airships. I am a shoemaker in my city,
many miles from here. Vun day der great ideas
comes to me. I see a bat fly. Quick, I say, I
will make me a airships like der bat. He is
heavier as a bird, yet he flies. So I stop making
shoes und I make airships. Iss it not so?" and
once more the smile illuminated the kindly face.</p>

<p>"Did you succeed?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Not at first," replied the German, gravely.
"Many, many times I t'ink I fly into der air, but
I falls to der ground. Sometimes it hurts. Vunce
I breaks my leg. But dot iss noddings. Ven I
get vell I make improvements. Now I haf der
great machine vot flies; yes?"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Dick, becoming interested
in the queer little man.</p>

<p>Then Herr Doodlebrod proceeded to explain.
He said he had heard of Dick's wealth, and, needing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251">251</a></span>
money to make some improvements in his
ship, he had taken it apart, shipped it to Hamilton
Corners, and followed the machine. The airship
was now at the freight station, he added, and
he was about to put it together and give a demonstration.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"To show you how he vorks. Den you vill
believe. You vill invest some money in it, I shall
make der improvements, get a better motor, und
ve win der government prize of ten thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Government prize?" repeated Dick.</p>

<p>The German explained at greater length. The
United States Government, in common with other
nations, recognizing the future in flying machines
for war purposes, had established a sort of competitive
test, with a substantial prize for the machine
which successfully fulfilled the conditions.
The chief ones were that the apparatus must move
through the air at a certain distance above the
ground, must carry two passengers, must be under
perfect control, and must stay up a certain
length of time. The German said his machine
answered nearly all these requirements, but that
he needed some new materials in it, and, more
than anything else, a new motor. He had used
up all his savings and had tried in vain to get
someone to help him. So, hearing of Dick, he had
decided to appeal to the millionaire's son.</p>

<p>"It iss not so much dot I need," he went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252">252</a></span>
"If I had five hundred dollars it would be enough.
My dear young frient, I appeal to you. I do not
ask you for dot moneys. I say just invest it in
my machine und ve vill be successful und get der
ten thousand dollars. You shall haf five thousand.
Iss not dot a good investment?"</p>

<p>A sudden idea came to Dick. An investment,
promising quick returns was just what he needed.
He had tried in vain to find one, and the time was
daily growing shorter. Here might be the very
chance he desired. But there was one important
thing. He must be sure that the airship would
fly. If it did not the prize would not be won
and he would be out five hundred dollars. Herr
Doodlebrod saw the doubt pictured on Dick's
face.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to take my word," he said,
gravely. "I only ask for a chance to show you.
See, I vill bring my machine here. I vill put him
togeder und I vill fly in him. Der trouble iss dot
I cannot go far enough or stay up long enough
vid der motor dot I haf. Wid a new vun I can.
I need der money for der new motor. Vill you
invest it?"</p>

<p>"I will!" exclaimed Dick, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Ach! Bless you, my young friend!" and
Herr Doodlebrod rushed over to the millionaire's
son and threw his arms about Dick, an embrace
somewhat difficult to escape from, so hearty
was it.</p>

<p>"But I must first talk to my father," went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253">253</a></span>
Dick, when Herr Doodlebrod's enthusiasm had
somewhat cooled down. "If the ship is a success
so far, and by investing five hundred dollars
a better one can be entered for the prize, so that
I can win part of it, I'm sure he would have no
objections."</p>

<p>"I go for my airship," said the German. "I
bring him here und in two days he is ready to
fly."</p>

<p>"Better not bring it here," advised Dick.
"There isn't much room to try it around the
house, and too big a crowd would gather. We'll
go off in the country somewhere. My father
owns some property about five miles from here.
It's a big level field, and I think that will be the
best place."</p>

<p>"Der very t'ing," assented the German, and
Dick told him how to get to it. Herr Doodlebrod
hurried off to the freight station to arrange for
having his dismantled flying machine brought to
the place where the test was to be made.</p>

<p>"This may be the very thing I've been looking
for," reasoned Dick. "Winning five thousand
dollars on an investment of five hundred is pretty
good. I guess that will fulfill the conditions of
mother's will. The question is: will it fly? But
if it doesn't at the first test I'm out nothing. And
if it flies with his present engine it surely will
with a better one. I must tell dad about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was not much impressed with
Herr Doodlebrod's plan. He admitted that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254">254</a></span>
government had offered a prize for a successful
airship, but he thought an old shoemaker was
hardly a possible person to win it.</p>

<p>"Scientific men have devoted many years of
study to the problem," he said, "and they have
not solved it yet. Still, of course, there's a
chance. As you say, you're out nothing if it
doesn't work the first time. But how about after
you have put the five hundred dollars in, and the
ship doesn't sail?"</p>

<p>"If it sails with the old engine it surely ought
to with the new," declared Dick, repeating his
favorite argument.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton consented that Dick might make
the investment. It was a queer one, he said, but
he agreed that if Herr Doodlebrod won the prize,
and gave Dick half, the terms of Mrs. Hamilton's
will would have been complied with.</p>

<p>"I'll get out of going to Uncle Ezra's yet,"
said the millionaire's son. "The mine failed, the
milk company failed, but the airship will beat
them all."</p>

<p>Herr Doodlebrod was a quick worker. In less
time than Dick had believed possible he had the
parts of the machine at the place decided on for
the test. There, under the inventor's directions,
men aided him in putting it together.</p>

<p>In shape it looked like a huge bat, and was
built on the principle of an aeroplane. At the
stern an immense rudder was turned by a small
gasolene motor, and there were several smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255">255</a></span>
rudders for directing the course of the apparatus.
There was a little car, of basket-work, amidships,
where the operator sat.</p>

<p>It was three days before the German was satisfied
that all was in readiness for the preliminary
test that was to tell if Dick would spend five hundred
dollars on improvements. In spite of the
attempt to keep the matter quiet the news leaked
out, and a big crowd gathered to see Herr Doodlebrod
make an attempt to fly.</p>

<p>"I do not promise so much to-day," he said, as
he saw that all was in readiness. "I vill go up,
circle about for a vile, und den I haf to come
down. My engine iss not powerful enough. But
vid der new one! Ach, den ve vill fly far und vin
der prize!"</p>

<p>He climbed into the little basket-car. Giving
a look over the various handles and levers, and
seeing that all was clear ahead, Herr Doodlebrod
started the motor. It began to revolve rapidly,
crackling like a battery of Gatling guns.</p>

<p>"Now I fly!" exclaimed the German, as he
threw on the clutch that operated the propeller.
The big airship trembled as the massive blades
whizzed through the air, and all eyes were fixed
on it to detect the moment when it might leave
the earth and sail aloft.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256">256</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>A DISASTROUS FLIGHT</h3>

<p>"There it goes!" cried a score of voices, Dick's
among them. And, sure enough, the airship
moved. Slowly, but gathering speed, like some
ungainly creature, it rose into the air in a slanting
direction. Up and up it went, until it was
about two hundred feet above the earth. Then
Herr Doodlebrod shifted a rudder and the machine
flew along on a level keel.</p>

<p>"Look at her go!" cried Frank Bender, for he
and all of Dick's boy chums had been invited to
the test. "Gee, but I wish I was in her!"</p>

<p>"You'd stand on your head on one of the propeller
blades, I suppose," commented Walter
Mead.</p>

<p>"Look, he's turning around!" exclaimed Frank,
to change the subject from his acrobatic abilities,
concerning which he was a bit sensitive.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Herr Doodlebrod was flying
around in a circle. He seemed to be able to manage
the ship perfectly, and Dick was delighted.
He already saw the prize won with the improved
craft, and himself holder of half the money.</p>

<p>"Look out, he's falling!" yelled Bricktop, suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257">257</a></span>
and the crowd of men, women, boys and
girls strained their eyes to see what was happening.
The airship was certainly coming down.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be killed! Isn't it terrible!" exclaimed
Birdy Lee, who, with some of her girl
friends, had come to watch the test.</p>

<p>"I'm going to faint!" declared Nettie Henderson,
covering her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't falling; he's steering it down!"
declared Dick. "He's all right!"</p>

<p>This announcement relieved the feelings of all.
Herr Doodlebrod was indeed coming down. But
he had his ship under perfect control, as shown
by the manner in which he steered it in a half
circle so as to return to the place from which he
had started. In a few minutes he allowed it to
come to a stop on the ground, in the midst of the
throng, where it alighted as gently as a bird.</p>

<p>"Vot I tell you?" he asked of Dick, triumphantly.
"I could haf stayed longer, but my engine
he vill not stand it. Ven ve gets der new motor&mdash;den
ve two vill sail in der clouds."</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to excuse me from the first
trip," objected Dick, with a smile. "I want to
see it tried first."</p>

<p>"It iss as safe as on der ground. Vait, I vill
show you. But now, are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dick. "I'm willing to invest
five hundred dollars in a new motor. Then we'll
see how she works."</p>

<p>"Und den ve vin der grand prize," announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258">258</a></span>
the German. "But I haf much to do. Ven can
you spare der money?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you want it. Perhaps you had
better come back to town with me and we can
talk it over with my father."</p>

<p>The airship was taken to a big barn near the
scene of the test and some workmen left in charge
to guard it from the curious crowd that gathered.
Herr Doodlebrod was as calm and collected as
though flying was an every-day accomplishment
of his, but Dick was quite excited over what had
taken place. Not only did he see the conditions
of his mother's will fulfilled, but he was glad of
the opportunity of taking part in helping to solve
the problem of aerial navigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was informed of the test and
its success. A form of agreement was drawn up
to protect the interests of all parties, and Dick
gave Herr Doodlebrod a check for five hundred
dollars, taking a mortgage on the machine as
security, a proposition the inventor himself suggested.</p>

<p>"Now I go to New York for der engine," he
announced.</p>

<p>Three days later a letter arrived from the German.
He said he was having some difficulties
in getting the engine made, but expected to be
back at Hamilton Corners in a week.</p>

<p>"You'll have to hustle, Dick, to win that prize
before the year expires," said his father, with a
smile. "Aren't you getting anxious?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"A little, but I guess it will all come out right.
It won't take long to install the engine once we
get it."</p>

<p>At the end of the week the German arrived
with the engine. He was enthusiastic over it, and
declared the government prize was already his.
He had communicated with a representative of
the War Department, who promised to be on
hand when the test was made, to see if Herr Doodlebrod's
machine answered the requirements.</p>

<p>"But haf no fears," boasted the inventor to
Dick. "It vill, und ve vill reap der reward."</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered Dick. "I haven't much
time left."</p>

<p>There were several delays in getting the ship
in shape for the decisive test. Herr Doodlebrod
was not satisfied with one of the rudders and
ordered a new one made. Dick urged haste, as
he had in mind the year limit fixed in his mother's
will.</p>

<p>"Easy, easy," counseled the German. "I haf
spent fifteen years on der machine; vot iss a few
days?"</p>

<p>"Much, to me," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Do not vorry, my young friend," comforted
the inventor. "You shall haf made der finest investment
vot effer vos. I, Herr Doodlebrod, say
so. Dot uncle of yours shall nefer get you."
For Dick had told the German about the conditions
of the will.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all their haste, it was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260">260</a></span>
time longer ere the machine was ready for the
test. The new motor had been put in, and,
though it was not tried in the air, worked perfectly.
The propeller revolved twice as fast, and
this, the inventor said, meant twice as much speed.</p>

<p>"To-morrow ve haf der test," announced the
German one evening, as he completed the last
change on the airship.</p>

<p>"Will the government official be here?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"He has promised. I go to bed early dot my
nerves may be in good shape. Haf no fears, I
vill fly, und fly far. Der requirements vill all be
met; I, Herr Doodlebrod, say so."</p>

<p>True to his promise, the government expert
on aerial matters arrived at Hamilton Corners
the next day. He sought out Herr Doodlebrod
and Dick, and said he was ready to see their
machine tested. The preparations had all been
made and there was no delay.</p>

<p>In Dick's runabout he, his father, the inventor
and the representative from the War Department,
Colonel Claflin, went out to the big field
where the airship awaited them. A large crowd
was waiting. It seemed that everyone in Hamilton
Corners, who could, by any possibility get
away from work, was there.</p>

<p>The airship was hauled from the barn where
it had been during the night, closely guarded
against possible accidents. It looked larger than
ever as, almost at the last minute, the inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261">261</a></span>
had increased the size of some of the bat-like
wings that extended on either side.</p>

<p>Herr Doodlebrod was the calmest person in
the big crowd. He went about looking at the
wheels, levers, rods, rudders and the propeller
as if he was merely a spectator. But his sharp
eyes did not miss anything. He detected a loose
screw in the motor and called for a tool to adjust
it. Then, having seen that the gasolene tank
was filled, and that the various handles for controlling
the machine worked smoothly, he took
his place in the basket-car, which had been enlarged.</p>

<p>"Vould you not like to come?" he asked of
Dick. But Dick shook his head in dissent.</p>

<p>"You come," the inventor invited Colonel
Claflin, but the government representative begged
to be excused.</p>

<p>"I may try it with you after your first flight,"
he said.</p>

<p>As the specifications called for the carrying of
two passengers the absence of one was made up
by some bags of sand to give the necessary
weight.</p>

<p>"Iss all clear?" asked Herr Doodlebrod.</p>

<p>"Clear she is," replied his chief helper.</p>

<p>"Den here I goes!" exclaimed the inventor as
he started the motor and threw in the clutch
operating the propeller.</p>

<p>The big arms beat the air and hummed shrilly
as they whizzed around. The new motor made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262">262</a></span>
the frail airship tremble. There was a moment's
hesitation, as if the craft hated to leave the earth,
and then, with a little jerk, it soared aloft.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>"She works! She works!" cried Dick, capering
about in delight. He thought the prize already
won. Even Colonel Claflin looked pleased.</p>

<p>Herr Doodlebrod deflected one of the rudders
and the airship went up at a sharp angle. In a
few seconds it was several hundred feet high.
Then it started to move about in a circle.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" murmured several.</p>

<p>"He seems to know his business," remarked
Mr. Hamilton. "I didn't believe it would work.
I haven't much faith in airships."</p>

<p>"Well, it has gone, so far," replied Colonel
Claflin. "But the test is not completed. Let's
watch him."</p>

<p>In a great circle Herr Doodlebrod sent his ship
around. He turned and twisted this way and
that. Then he set off in a straight line, as called
for by the government requirements.</p>

<p>But suddenly something happened. There was
a sharp sound, like an explosion, up on the airship.
The big propellor was seen to fly to pieces
and come fluttering down, a mass of twisted wire
and cloth.</p>

<p>Then came another ominous sound. It was a
louder explosion, and a sheet of fire was seen to
envelop the ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"His gasolene tank has gone up!" exclaimed
Colonel Claflin. "He'll be killed!"</p>

<p>The airship seemed rent apart. The two big,
bat-like wings soared off to one side. Rudders,
wheels, levers and parts of machinery came raining
down. The bat wings settled to the earth
more slowly.</p>

<p>"Where is the inventor?" asked Mr. Hamilton.
"Has he been blown to pieces?"</p>

<p>"It looks so," replied the colonel. "Poor chap!
I'm afraid he didn't know so much about airships
as he thought."</p>

<p>There came a cry from the crowd, not a cry
of horror, but of wonder. The colonel, Dick and
Mr. Hamilton looked toward where they pointed.</p>

<p>There, falling through space from his wrecked
airship, was Herr Doodlebrod.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264">264</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>GOOD NEWS&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried the crowd, again and
again.</p>

<p>And there was no small cause for wonder; for,
though the inventor was falling to earth, he had
hold of one of the immense bat-like wings. It
acted exactly as a parachute, the air catching under
the curved surface. Thus the inventor came
down so slowly that he was not in the slightest
danger. It was a wonderful escape.</p>

<p>No sooner had he alighted than he hurried up
to where Dick stood, his face showing the sorrow
he felt.</p>

<p>"Vell, my young friend," said Herr Doodlebrod,
"ve haf made vun grand mistake. But I
know vat der trouble vas. I need a stronger propellor.
Ve vill make vun at vunce, und haf anodder
test."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it will be too late for me," remarked
Dick, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Ach, dot iss so," assented the German. "But
neffer mind. I shall yet fly. I vill at once proceed
to build a new machine. I vill make some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265">265</a></span>
more shoes until I haf saved money enough, und
den I try again," and he smiled as though what
had just happened was the thing he had always
desired.</p>

<p>The crowd gathered about the disabled airship,
which was mostly consumed by the flames
before it had reached the earth. Herr Doodlebrod
had the men save what they could, and, not
a bit discouraged, he set about packing up the
remnants to take away.</p>

<p>"Too bad," remarked Colonel Claflin, "but such
accidents will happen. He's a cool fellow, at any
rate."</p>

<p>Dick and his father went home together in the
runabout, the colonel declining their invitation to
pay them a visit. The German inventor went
away and that was the last seen of him.</p>

<p>Swiftly the days passed, and in sheer desperation
Dick invested several hundred dollars in three
different schemes. But none of them paid. In
one he lost all his money and in the others he got
his money back and that was all.</p>

<p>"It's no use!" he groaned to himself. "I guess
it takes a brighter fellow than I to make money."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton did not say much, but he was
almost as anxious as his son, for he did not wish
to see Dick fail.</p>

<p>One morning Mr. Hamilton went out with Dick
in the youth's runabout.</p>

<p>"Well, my son, to-morrow is your birthday,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266">266</a></span>
remarked the parent, after speaking of many
things in general.</p>

<p>"I know it, dad," was the gloomy answer. And
then Dick went on: "I suppose there is no way
of getting clear of the provisions of that will?"</p>

<p>"I know of none. Your dear departed mother's
wishes must be respected."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" Dick gave a long sigh. "Well,
perhaps I can stand Uncle Ezra, but it's going
to be a&mdash;er&mdash;a stiff proposition."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," commented Mr. Hamilton. "But
perhaps it will be a good thing for you. Your
Uncle Ezra has excellent discipline, and he's a
good man of business."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that, dad."</p>

<p>Father and son did not say much during the
ride home, as each was busy with his thoughts.
As Dick went up the steps of the Hamilton mansion
the butler met him at the door.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Ezra is here," he announced.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" commented Dick, with a groan.</p>

<p>"Ah, Nephew Richard," was Mr. Larabee's
greeting when Dick found him in the library.
"I've come to pay <i>you</i> a little visit, you see. I
happened to remember that to-morrow is your
birthday, and, according to the&mdash;to the provisions
of your mother's will you may be going to pay <i>me</i>
a visit. I can't say I altogether approve of that
will, still we will not discuss that now. The main
thing is, Have you made the paying investment
called for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I haven't, Uncle Ezra."</p>

<p>"Hum, well, I didn't think you would. Boys
have no head for business nowadays. I knew
your money would do you little good. So you
are to come and live a year with me, eh?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Yes, of course, Uncle Ezra,"
and Dick tried to make his voice sound cheerful,
but it was hard work when he thought of the
gloomy house.</p>

<p>"Well, I told Samanthy I'd bring you back
with me, and she's going to have your room all
ready. Then, too, I've arranged to send you to a
good boarding school. It is taught by a friend of
mine; a man who doesn't believe in nonsense."</p>

<p>Dick could see, in fancy, the kind of a school
Uncle Ezra would pick out, and he could also
fancy the principal of it, a harsh, stern old man.
He sighed, but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>"So I will take you away with me to-morrow,"
went on Mr. Larabee, rubbing his hands as if delighted
at the prospect. "I shall&mdash;Gracious goodness!
What's that?" he exclaimed, jumping from
his chair, as a loud growl sounded from under
the library table. "Have you a wild animal in
here, Nephew Richard?"</p>

<p>"I guess it's my bulldog, Grit," replied Dick.
"Here, Gibbs," calling the butler, "have Grit
taken to the stable."</p>

<p>Grit was led away, growling out a protest.</p>

<p>"I can't bear dogs," said Uncle Ezra. "You'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268">268</a></span>
not be allowed to have one at The Firs, so you
had better get rid of this one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose I can leave Grit home," answered
Dick, with a sigh. "Can I get you something
to eat, Uncle Ezra?" he asked, trying to be
hospitable.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Nephew Richard. I never eat
between meals, nor do I allow it at my house.
Three times a day is enough to eat."</p>

<p>"Maybe you would like some lemonade; it's
quite warm to-day." Dick was both hungry and
thirsty.</p>

<p>"No, lemonade is bad for the liver, I have
heard. You may get me some plain water, if you
please."</p>

<p>"And I've got to live a year with him," mused
Dick as he went out to get his uncle a drink.
"Why, oh why, didn't some of my investments
succeed?"</p>

<p>Dick spent a miserable evening with his uncle.
Mr. Hamilton came home from the bank, whither
he had gone after the ride, and greeted his
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll have to take Dick back
with you," said the millionaire, with an attempt
at cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"I intend to, and when he comes back from
living with me he'll be a different lad," said Mr.
Larabee, grimly.</p>

<p>"I guess that's true enough," thought Dick.</p>

<p>He dreamed that night that he went to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269">269</a></span>
uncle's house in an airship, and when they got
there it turned into a vault in a cemetery and he
was made a prisoner in it. He awoke with a start
to find his uncle calling to him from the hall outside
his door.</p>

<p>"Come, Nephew Richard," said Mr. Larabee.
"It's six o'clock, and you'll have to get up early
when you're at my house. Might as well begin
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is a beautiful birthday," said Dick,
with a groan, as he began to dress. "Six o'clock!
Ugh!"</p>

<p>It was arranged that they were to take an early
train to Dankville, and, soon after breakfast,
Dick, having packed his suitcase, and arranged
to have his trunk forwarded to him at The Firs,
went to the library where his father and uncle
were waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Well, Dick," remarked Mr. Hamilton, with a
little catch in his voice, for he hated to part with
his son, though he knew the experience might be
good for him. "I guess it's time to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied Dick, trying to keep
back the tears, which, in spite of all he could do,
would come to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, we must be going," agreed Mr. Larabee.
"I'll write to you, Mortimer, and let you know
how Dick gets along. I have no doubt but I'll
make a fine man of him. Too much wealth is bad
for a young man. Come along, Nephew Richard."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270">270</a></span></p>

<p>Dick started to leave the room. At that instant
the doorbell rang and Gibbs, answering it, came
into the library and announced:</p>

<p>"Mr. Henry Darby and his son, to see Mr.
Dick."</p>

<p>"I guess they have come to say good-bye," said
the millionaire's son. "Show them in, Gibbs."</p>

<p>"Hank" Darby did not need any "showing."
He was in the library as Gibbs turned to go back
to the door.</p>

<p>"Excuse this intrusion," he began, "but I am in
a hurry. I have a very important scheme on and
I must attend to it at once. But my son insisted
that we come and tell Mr. Dick what has happened,
he being a partner in our enterprise&mdash;The
International and Consolidated Old Metal Corporation."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick!" cried Henry, unable to wait for
his father to tell the news in his slow, pompous
way. "Things are in fine shape. In fact the old
metal business can now pay a dividend."</p>

<p>"A dividend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you remember me telling you about a lot
of old scrap-iron and steel dad bought, thinking
it had platinum in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it didn't have any in."</p>

<p>"Merely an error in judgment," murmured Mr.
Darby. "Any business man, with large schemes
on hand, is liable to make them."</p>

<p>"Well, while the metal didn't have any platinum
in it, it had a peculiar quality of steel. It is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271">271</a></span>
valuable, and I&mdash;that is we"&mdash;turning toward his
father&mdash;"have just sold it to a large firm that
wants it to make some very fine springs with."</p>

<p>"Yes, the deal is just completed," broke in Mr.
Darby. "My judgment in that old metal is confirmed.
I have accepted an offer of two thousand
dollars for it. Under the terms of the incorporation
papers one-half of that goes to Dick. I now
take pleasure in handing you my check for that
amount, as president of The International and
Consolidated Old Metal Corporation," and with
a grand air "Hank" handed Dick a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"Is this mine?" asked the millionaire's son, in
some bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Mr. Darby. "It is part of the
return from your investment of two hundred and
fifty dollars which you put into the firm of which
I am president, you treasurer, and my son secretary
and general manager."</p>

<p>"That is, I collect the old iron and sell it," explained
Henry, seeing that Mr. Larabee looked
puzzled. "Dick was kind enough to invest some
money with our company last year, and I am glad
I can make a return for him&mdash;or, rather, dad can,
for he bought the metal that turned out so valuable."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;" began Dick, a light slowly
breaking over him, "without intending it, I have
made a good, paying investment. A thousand
dollars for two hundred and fifty is good, isn't
it, dad?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine, I would say," cried Mr. Hamilton, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"And this is my birthday! The year is just
up!" went on Dick. "I&mdash;I won't have to go and
live with Uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped in some confusion.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that this is a bona-fide
investment, Mortimer?" asked Mr. Larabee,
turning to his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Perfectly legal and legitimate," interrupted
Mr. Darby. "Here is a copy of the incorporation
agreement."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Uncle Ezra, with a disappointed
air, "I suppose you have fulfilled the conditions
of your mother's will, Nephew Richard.
I congratulate you," and he shook hands rather
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, who would have thought it?" gasped
Dick, hardly able to believe his good fortune. "I
never gave that investment a thought&mdash;in fact, I
never considered it an investment, Henry."</p>

<p>"It was, all the same, and I'm glad I am able
to do you a favor, for you did me a mighty good
turn. The old metal business is in fine shape,
and I have more than I can attend to."</p>

<p>"Yes, we must be going, I have a big scheme
on hand," put in Mr. Darby. "A very big scheme,
there are enormous possibilities in it. <i>Enormous</i>,
sir!"</p>

<p>"If they only come out," said Henry, with a
laugh, as he and his father withdrew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273">273</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if you are not to come back with me, I
suppose I may as well be going," remarked Uncle
Ezra, after a pause. "Samanthy will be looking
for me. I'll say good-bye."</p>

<p>He turned to go, and at that instant an ominous
growl came from under the library table.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Mr. Larabee in alarm.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think it's Grit," replied Dick, trying not
to laugh.</p>

<p>"That bulldog again!" exclaimed Mr. Larabee.
"I hate dogs! I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what he wished he never said, for Grit,
seeming to know that an enemy of his master
was present, rushed from under the table, and,
with opened mouth, though he probably would
not have bitten him, rushed at Uncle Ezra.</p>

<p>"Here, Grit!" cried Dick. "Come back here
this instant!"</p>

<p>But, with a wild yell, Mr. Larabee ran from the
room, followed by the dog. Out through the hall
and down the steps Dick's uncle ran, the dog
growling behind him. But Gibbs captured Grit
at the front door and held him.</p>

<p>"Grit! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
asked Dick, trying not to laugh. But Grit growled
in a way that seemed to say he was not in the
least ashamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Larabee hurried off down the street, not
once looking back.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a narrow escape," murmured
Dick. "Eh, dad?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274">274</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose so. Still a visit to your uncle's house
might have done you good," added the millionaire,
with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, dad," went on Dick, "I suppose that as
I have fulfilled all the conditions of the will I
may do pretty nearly as I please."</p>

<p>"Not altogether," and the millionaire spoke
rather gravely. "It is true you will have a certain
control of your money left you by your
mother, but you remember I told you, a year ago,
there were certain other provisions of the will.
One of them is that you attend a good military
school."</p>

<p>"A military school!" exclaimed Dick, his eyes
sparkling. "That will be fine."</p>

<p>"Yes, but wait. The conditions are that you
attend there and become popular with the students
in spite of your wealth. In short, that you make
your own way up without the aid of your millions,
and become one of the upper classmen
through your own efforts. It is not going to be
as easy as you think, but I trust you can do it.
There is no great hurry about it. I will give you
a few months of leisure and then you must get
ready for a new life."</p>

<p>"Oh, dad, I think it will be fine!" exclaimed
Dick; "I've always wanted to go to a military
academy!" But he little knew of what was in
store for him. Those who wish to follow the
further adventures of the young millionaire will
find them set forth in the second volume of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275">275</a></span>
series, entitled "Dick Hamilton's Cadet Days; or
the Handicap of a Millionaire's Son."</p>

<p>"Well, Grit, you certainly routed Uncle Ezra,"
said Dick, as he patted the ugly head of his pet.
"I don't know as I blame you. But it's all over
now, though I had some stirring times while it
lasted." And, whistling gaily, Dick went out to
deposit in the bank his thousand-dollar check,
the profits of his one paying investment.</p>
